The same is the case of a sex position when a man is on top. This is that time when one needs to make the classic position more elegant and find out why it is a classic position. Another thing that needs to be understood is that when the man is on top&#44; it does not have to mean that the woman is going to experience idle and powerful sexual gerations. Nor these positions can be called the boring positions of the past just the way some people think about the positions that involve men on top. By making some small changes these positions can be made elegant. In all this positions effort needs to be made by the man. Before any inital position it is better to talk to your partner. If there is any kind of communication gap&#44; then no position would be comfortable for both the partners. This means that every woman wants that her mate has such size and shape that can push her to the limits of sexual excitement and for this there is a need for a great position that has been discussed and decided according to her needs and which pushes her to the limit of sexual climax. If they are successful in doing this just once&#44; they can repeat whenever they want to reach the limits of sexual excitement. One thing that needs to be told is that most men choose men on top position so that they can reach an orgasm. This is why the men on top position is a powerful position. But is in this position is the man is fast and powerful from the begining then it may lead to loss of feeling and stamina at the end. This position is very good for those who are relatively new to sex&#44; but when excitement is taken into consideration this position is good for everyone. This is why it is necessary that the women tell their partner to stay in control and try to experiment and determine which position is good for satisfcation of both their needs.,142_195 ,A3NOO9K3CY1YU5 ,Navaratri festival begins on the first day of waxing moon in the month of Ashwin (mid-September to mid-October),831_131 ,AFD2H8FZGWTBE ,Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University&#44; Muzzaferpur,1529_60 ,A16IVTYAYSV3SA ,Among these there are: &#39;Chashar Song&#39; (The Masque of a Farmer)&#44; &#39;Shakuni Badh&#39; (The Killing of Shakuni (a villain of the India epic Mahabharata))&#44; &#39;Raja Judhisthirer Song&#39; (The Masque of the King Judhisthir (a king in the Indian epic Mahabharata))&#44; &#39;Data Karna&#39; (The Benevolent King Karna (a king of the Indian epic Mahabharata))&#44; &#39;Akbar Badsah&#39; (The Emperor Akbar)&#44; &#39;Kabi Kalidas&#39; (Poet Kalidas)&#44; &#39;vidyabhutum&#39; (Scary Education)&#44; &#39;Rajputrer Gaan&#39; (The Songs of the Prince)&#44; &#39;Buro Shaliker Ghade Ron&#39; (The Fur in the Shoulder of an Old Shalik Bird (a small yellow-beaked singing bird)) and &#39;Meghnad Badh&#39; (The Assassination of Meghnad (a prince of the Indian epic Ramayana)).,2730_51 ,A3F9QBUALMKO1 ,Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das&#44; famous freedom fighter and the first mayor of Kolkata.12218_40 ,A2KJ7A30NJYY1K ,Total runs scored by batting team can be increased in these ways when bowler  1).

It was built according to Vaishnavaite traditions.  One story of the site&#39;s origin is as follows: The sage Agastya wanted to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site. However&#44; the statue that was made could not be installed as the toenail of the deity got broken. The sage was upset over this and performed a penance for Lord Shiva. When Lord Shiva appeared&#44; he said the place suits Shiva better as it resembles Kailash. Agastya then requested Lord Shiva to give the devotees a Parvathi Goddess as Lord Uma Maheswara in a single stone&#44; which Lord Shiva obliged.  A second story is as follows: Chitteppa&#44; a devotee of Lord Shiva&#44; was worshiping Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva appeared to him as a tiger. Chitteppa understood that it was Lord Shiva in tiger form&#44; and shouted Neganti Shivanu ne khanti (meaning: I saw Shiva I saw)&#44; and danced with joy. There is a cave called Chitteppa nearby.    The story according to the priests is that when the sage Agastya compleated his uttara desha yatra and started dakshina desha yatra he found the beautiful and pleasent place called yaganti( Nekanti-i have seen)and thought to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site . while roaming around caves one of the caves was found to have a very old statue of Lord Vishnu . After all the yagna&#44; homa and poojas he found that the statue really contains a small defect as broken nail on the foot thumb finger. To seek an explanation he prayed to Shiva and Shiva explained that at this place which contains natural springs and nature only I can be worshipped. Then the sage Agastya asked a boom to Shiva to reside in this place for eternity with Mother Parvathi. So this place is called as Umamahesware (ume: parvathi&#44; maheswara: shiva) temple. The shrine contains the statue of Shiva and Parvathi on a single stone.,7686_46 ,A30DCB3TFOQO3B ,In 2000 June&#44; World Health Organisation issued some guidelines for the treatment this disease.,47017_149 ,A3RS82XNENF2NT ,as a result there are no abnormal god abuse laws in france,8066_129 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,In 2008 Presidential election&#44; political candidates are using the You Tube for the campaign.

Forrest Parry&#44; an IBM Engineer&#44; had the idea of securing a piece of magnetic tape&#44; the predominant storage medium at the time&#44; to a plastic card base. He became frustrated because every adhesive he tried produced unacceptable results. The tape strip either warped or its characteristics were affected by the adhesive&#44; rendering the tape strip unusable. After a frustrating day in the laboratory&#44; trying to get the right adhesive&#44; he came home with several pieces of magnetic tape and several plastic cards. As he walked in the door at home&#44; his wife was ironing and watching TV. She immediately saw the frustration on his face and asked what was wrong. He explained the source of his frustration: inability to get the tape to &quot;stick&quot; to the plastic in a way that would work. She said&#44; &quot;Here&#44; let me try the iron.&quot; She did and the problem was solved. The heat of the iron was just high enough to bond the tape to the card.There were a number of steps required to convert the magnetic striped media into an industry acceptable device. These steps included: 1) Creating the international standards for stripe record content&#44; including which information&#44; in what format&#44; and using which defining codes. 2) Field testing the proposed device and standards for market acceptance. 3) Developing the manufacturing steps needed to mass produce the large number of cards required. 4) Adding stripe issue and acceptance capabilities to available equipment.

Bell Labs&#44; frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims&#44; slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics&#44; Ken Thompson&#44; Dennis Ritchie&#44; M. D. McIlroy&#44; and J. F. Ossanna&#44;[3] decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. At the time&#44; Ritchie says &quot;What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming&#44; but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing&#44; as supplied by remote-access&#44; time-shared machines&#44; is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch&#44; but to encourage close communication.&quot;[3]  While Ken Thompson still had access to the Multics environment&#44; he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it. He also programmed a game called Space Travel&#44; but the game needed a more efficient and less expensive machine to run on&#44; and eventually a little-used PDP-7 at Bell Labs fit the bill.[4] On this PDP7&#44; a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie&#44; including Rudd Canaday&#44; developed a hierarchical file system&#44; the notions of computer processes and device files&#44; a command-line interpreter&#44; and some small utility programs,1257_167 ,A3S0F1GABMBS9P ,Private Intermediate colleges - Gouthami&#44; Vignan&#44; Vikas&#44; Krishnaveni&#44; Srichaitanya,1359_395 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Vishakapatnam is the center for east indian naval command.,45708_39 ,A1O9BHBJKVI5PS ,As the name suggests the woman behaves as if she is riding a horse. Just as the rider jumps up and down because of the jerks of the horse during riding&#44; similarly the woman creates this state during coitus. This position is one of the most liked positions for some women. This is also liked by women who feel it is their right to start and men like to see them do this. In this the man lies down on his back. During this he can raise his shoulders/head region with the help of a pillow. Now the woman should sit facing him. During this the man&#39;s body will be between the woman&#39;s legs and the woman&#39;s vagina will be above or in front of the man&#39;s penis. After this the horse-rider position divides into two methods. In the first method the woman brings her face very close to the man&#39;s face. This gives an opportunity to kiss. During this she places her hands next to the man&#39;s shoulders and uses them for support and her legs are parallel to the bed. In the second method the woman places her hands behind her and bends backwards. In this method the man can fully see his penis entering the vagina which is helpful in greatly exciting him.

Scientifically&#44; it is established that there is no harm by this process.  Here the methods of self excitement of sexual organs by women are being discussed&#44; which give them unlimited sensual pleasure and also give them intense arousal&#44; whether she alone or with her partner.  If women did not arouse their sex organs by self&#44; there is a possibility that they are being deprived of adequate  excitement from the sex act.  On an average&#44; males indulge in masturbation from the age of 12-13.  As against this&#44; females start masturbation towards the end of puberty (from 13 to 19 years)&#44; but this matter remains so guarded and secretive that it is not allowed to be brought to the fore by anybody in any discussion also.  On attaining of complete puberty&#44; the issue of masturbation tends to be an open secret&#44; most people want it to be covered under veils&#44; but nowadays some youth are now breaking these restrictions and discussing the methods of masturbation and openly taking part in it.,15677_0 ,A3GI3466NOP5HJ ,China is one of the world&#39;s oldest civilizations and is located in the eastern part of the Asian continent.,7823_21 ,AG1D5L9BVQHIR ,Due to power breakdown Kundan lal sehgal neglected to perform,1528_340 ,A2JPXAF2MC24F7 ,On the other hand&#44; he accepted liberal and universal humanitarianism as the standard in all matters of politics&#44; religion&#44; philosophy&#44; education etc. in his collection of essays &#39;Atmoshakti&#39; (1905)&#44; &#39;Bharatbarsho&#39; (1906)&#44; &#39;Kalantar&#39; (1907)&#44; &#39;Raja Praja&#39; (1908)&#44; &#39;Swadesh&#39; (1908)&#44; &#39;Somaj&#39; (1908)&#44; &#39;Dharmo&#39; (1909)&#44; &#39;Manusher Dharmo&#39; (1933) and &#39;Shantiniketan&#39; (1935) etc.,11358_21 ,A2HFASY1SVXPSP ,Bunty Aur Babli was a box office hit and her works in other films were also appreciated21713_173 ,A39DT9DGR2XZF6 ,The Kufis who invited Hussain by writing him letters to Kufa&#44;  according to a reference their population was 12&#44;000 while other reference says it was 18&#44;000&#44; however&#44; when the war situation came to him&#44; these very men betrayed Hussain and didnt support him and thus remained a mute spectator&#44; Hussain thus had to ask his die hard supporters and friends to move and thus had to give their lives,10824_236 ,A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST ,While the treasure and wealth received after the war would be used for the welfare of the people.,1149_164 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,prior releases of Windows supported per-file encryption using Encrypting File System&#44; the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista include BitLocker Drive Encryption which can protect entire volumes&#44; notably the operating system volume. However&#44; BitLocker requires approximately a 1.5-gigabyte partition to be permanently unencrypted and to contain system files in order for Windows to boot. In normal circumstances&#44; the only time this partition is accessed is when the computer is booting&#44; or when there is a Windows update that changes files in this area which is a legitimate reason to access this section of the drive. The area can be a potential security issue&#44; because a hexadecimal editor (such as dskprobe.exe)&#44; or malicious software running with administrator and/or kernel level privileges would be able to write to this &quot;Ghost Partition&quot; and allow a piece of malicious software to compromise the system&#44; or disable the encryption. BitLocker can work in conjunction with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cryptoprocessor (version 1.2) embedded in a computer&#39;s motherboard&#44; or with a USB key.[38] However&#44; as with other full disk encryption technologies&#44; BitLocker is vulnerable to a cold boot attack&#44; especially where TPM is used as a key protector without a boot PIN being required too,1395_189 ,AE2CDTF7VQXCE ,Women wearing &quot;Burkha&quot;&#44; strictly following religious traditions is widely seen here.,6271_2 ,A3RS82XNENF2NT ,june 9 : international soccer world cup started in germany,884_196 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,During the years of war&#44; one player who was always respected was Don Bradman&#44;who has always remained the greatest batsman&#44; according to his statistics.

Today&#39;s Unix systems are split into various branches&#44; developed over time by AT&amp;Toriginally on the PDP-11 architecture (the 2.xBSD releases&#44; ending with 2.11BSD) and later for the VAX-11 (the 4.x BSD releases). Many contributions to Unix first appeared on BSD releases&#44; notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel. The BSD effort produced several significant releases that contained network code: 4.1cBSD&#44; 4.2BSD&#44; 4.3BSD&#44; 4.3BSD-Tahoe (&quot;Tahoe&quot; being the nickname of the Computer Consoles Inc. Power 6/32 architecture that was the first non-DEC release of the BSD kernel)&#44; Net/1&#44; 4.3BSD-Reno (to match the &quot;Tahoe&quot; naming&#44; and that the release was something of a gamble)&#44; Net/2&#44; 4.4BSD&#44; and 4.4BSD-lite.,7918_259 ,A1Z53763UXALP ,BSK press&#44; which was run very efficiently by Nagi Reddy&#44; beautifully published Chandamama.,1359_104 ,A8VHPYIT5L7EA ,1957 - Light house has been reconstructed on Dolphins nose,872_291 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,The Former President of South Africa&#44; Nelson Mandela&#44; is a folower of Gandhiji.In 2003&#44;he unveiled a statue of Gandhi in Johannsberg in spite of strong opposition by Gandhijis critics.Bhana and Wahed have described events that happened during the unveiling of the statue&#44; in their book&#44; The Making Of A Political Reformer:Gandhi In South Africa&#44;1913-1914.In the Chapter&#44; Gandhijis gift to South Africa&#44;They write&#44;&quot;Gandhiji inspired active reformers in South Africa to end white superiority.

Possible explanations are that such users only register for a single purpose&#44; or are scared away by their experiences.[143] Goldman writes that editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals&#44; such as signing talk pages&#44; implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders&#44; increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders will target their contributions as a threat. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs; the contributor is expected to build a user page&#44; learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes&#44; submit to an arcane dispute resolution process&#44; and learn a &quot;baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references.&quot; Non-logged-in users are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia&#44;[144] as &quot;participants are accredited by members of the wiki community&#44; who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product&#44; on the basis of their ongoing participation&#44;&quot;[145] but the contribution histories of IP addresses cannot necessarily with any certainty be credited to&#44; or blamed upon&#44; a particular user.,72080_56 ,AE9QK78PC9KRL ,Though sexual love is a part of in Hindu philosophy&#44; sexual love theory is not in sexual book.,1152_162 ,A3T1KZYNIUW9IN ,&quot;It burnt like Sri Sri&quot;  - Maripanda appalaswamy,28539_112 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,It is useful to consider that environmental policy comprises two major terms: environment and policy. Environment primarily refers to the ecological dimension (ecosystems)&#44; but can also take account of social dimension (quality of life) and an economic dimension (resource management). [2] Policy can be defined as a &quot;course of action or principle adopted or proposed by a government&#44; party&#44; business or individual&quot; [3]. Thus&#44; environmental policy focuses on problems arising from human impact on the environment&#44; which retroacts onto human society by having a (negative) impact on human values such as good health or the &#39;clean and green&#39; environment.    Environmental issues generally addressed by environmental policy include (but are not limited to) air and water pollution&#44; waste management&#44; ecosystem management&#44; biodiversity protection&#44; and the protection of natural resources&#44; wildlife and endangered species. Relatively recently&#44; environmental policy has also attended to the communication of environmental issues,1405_52 ,A3NOO9K3CY1YU5 ,In 1853&#44; the first passenger railway line of India  which connected Bombay with Thane&#44; was established,1011_19 ,A3KCINWW8X6DCQ ,Climate changes is the reason for Earth&#39;s shape to change,2730_61 ,A3PSUT241Y12MZ ,Most notable among these are- Manasha bijoy Kabbo of Biprodas Piplai(writing period 1495 A.D.)&#44;Kabi Kangan Chandi of Mukundaram Chatterjee(writing period 1594-1606 A.D.)&#44;Padmabati of Syed Alaul(writing period 1645-52 A.D.)&#44;Kalika mangal of Krishanramdas(writing period 1676-77 A.D.)Vasha Vagabat of Shanaton Ghoshal(writing period 1679-80 A.D.)&#44;and Naradpuran of Krishnadas(writing period 1692 A.D.).,1495_134 ,A16IVTYAYSV3SA ,The government was formed by choosing Seikh Mujib as the President even in his absence.28455_286 ,A3JYPR03KI0JWC ,On April 1&#44; 1933 at 10 am on local time attackers came out in all areas of Germany and stood in front of Jew&#39;s business center.

He was thus named because the hair (roma) on his body was thrilled (harshana) when he heard the Puranas from his teacher. It was Romaharshana who related the stories of the Puranas to everyone else. The Bhagavata Purana says the Romaharshana had a son named Suta and it was this son who related the story of that particular Purana to the other sages . On the other hand&#44; Romaharshana himself belonged to the suta class&#44; so that he too could be addressed as Suta. From reading the Garuda Purana&#44; one does get the impression that it is Romaharshana himself who is relating the story&#44; and not his son.  To come back to the point&#44; Romaharshana came to a forest known as Naimisharanya. He sat there and contemplated the mysteries of the Lord Vishnu.  Several other rishis (sages) led by Shounaka also came to the forest. They told Romaharshana&#44; &quot;Sage&#44; you know everything. Who is the god of all gods? Who is to be worshipped? What does one meditate on? Who destroys evil? How did the world come to be created? What is dharma (righteousness)?

Since environmental issues often have many different aspects&#44; several policy instruments may be needed to adequately address each one. Furthermore&#44; instrument mixes may allow firms greater flexibility in finding ways to comply with government policy while reducing the uncertainty in the cost of doing so. However&#44; instrument mixes must be carefully formulated so that the individual measures within them do not undermine each other or create a rigid and cost-ineffective compliance framework. Also&#44; overlapping instruments lead to unnecessary administrative costs&#44; making implementation of environmental policies more costly than necessary.In order to help governments realize their environmental policy goals&#44; the OECD Environment Directorate studies and collects data on the efficiency of the environmental instruments governments use to achieve their goals as well as their consequences for other policies.,5008_9 ,AA4XJ5YP5SLN2 ,Language of Aryans is sanskrit and religion is vedic or old religion afterwards this religion is called hindus,74_47 ,AGUEWXL636ANK ,When any word is not used then that word could be &#39;a&#39;,1099_208 ,A2HFASY1SVXPSP ,The most prominent sports centers in Dhaka are Outer Stadium adjacent to Bangabandhu National Stadium&#44; National Swimming Pool&#44; Maolana Bhasani Hockey Stadium&#44; Mohammad Ali Boxing Stadium&#44; Woodenfloor Gymnesium&#44; Dhaka District Sports Council&#44; Mirpur National Stadium and its adjacent Swimming Complex&#44; Mirpur National Indoor Stadium&#44;  Army Stadium at Banani and Navi Swimming Complex.,1495_111 ,A3F9QBUALMKO1 ,Before midnight&#44; Dhaka was burning&#44; especially Hindu areas on the eastern side.10824_75 ,A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR ,But staunch opposition to the reforms was met from the conservative thinking religious clerics and military.

Each user had sole use of the computer and would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards and tape. The program would be loaded into the machine&#44; and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights. It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine&#44; and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the Universal Turing machine.[citation needed]  Later machines came with libraries of software&#44; which would be linked to a user&#39;s program to assist in operations such as input and output and generating computer code from human-readable symbolic code. This was the genesis of the modern-day operating system. However&#44; machines still ran a single job at a time. At Cambridge University in England the job queue was at one time a washing line from which tapes were hung with different colored clothes-pegs to indicate job-priority.,55057_91 ,A2ZKW63AU1NQ21 ,First China- Japan War took place during 1894-1895.

In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598&#44; it is called creckett. It met between Middle-age business connection&#44; south-est England and county of flanders&#44; which supposed to be Duchy of Burgundy. This name supposed to be derived from Krik(-e) of Middle Dutch or in old English Kris or Krise which means stick (Baisakhi in Hindi). That sounds like Old French word Criquet which means a kind of stick or club. In Samuel johnson&#39;s directory&#44; he described cricket as &quot;cryce&quot; which means Saskon-A Stick. One more probable evidence is middle dutch word krickstoel which means - a long beneath stul which is used in church for resting knee&#44; that looks like old age long two wicket and stumps.

Typically Linux is packaged in a format known as a Linux distribution for desktop and server use. Linux distributions include the Linux kernel and all of the supporting software required to run a complete system&#44; such as utilities and libraries&#44; the X Window System&#44; the GNOME and KDE desktop environments&#44; and the Apache HTTP Server. Commonly used applications with desktop Linux systems include the Mozilla Firefox web-browser&#44; the OpenOffice.org office application suite and the GIMP image editor.  The name &quot;Linux&quot; comes from the Linux kernel&#44; originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.

Most of the radiation emitted from the upper layers goes into the space&#44; whereas the radiation from the lower layers enters the atmosphere again and gets absorbed by it.  In this way&#44; the green house effect depends on the rate of decrease of temperature with the height.  If the temperature decrease rate is less green house effect is less and vice versa.  Theories and models both indicate that due to the worming effect&#44; the decrease in temperature as we go up is reduced.  A negative lapse rate feedback is produced and this makes the green house effect weak.  Calculation of the rate of change of temperature with height is very subtle and sensitive to tiny changes&#44; and so it is very difficult to find out whether the model represents the reality or not.,9201_162 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,Emergence of terrorism in 2005.An article and quantified study by Rik&#44; Kulset and Tunn&#44; Wan De Wurdey.,831_155 ,A3NOO9K3CY1YU5 ,Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital&#44; Gaya,2730_102 ,A2JPXAF2MC24F7 ,The important leaders of this movement were Raja Rammohan Roy (1772-1833)&#44; Henry Luis Vivian de Rojio (1809-1831)&#44; Ramtanu Lahiri (1813-1898)&#44; Maharshi Debendranth Thakur (1817-1905)&#44; Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820-1891)&#44; Bankim Chandra Chattopadhaya (1838-1894)&#44; Ramkrishna Paramhansa (1886-1886)&#44; Keshab Chadra Sen (1838-1884)&#44; Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) etc.,2730_7 ,A3F9QBUALMKO1 ,Till 1911&#44; Kolkata was the capital of Bengal as well as the whole of British India.849_31 ,A2KJ7A30NJYY1K ,Chairman of the central executive committee of the All Russian Congress of Soviets (1917 to 1922)&#44; Chairman of the central executive committee of the All Russian Congress of Soviets (1922 to 1938)&#44; Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of USSR (1938 to 1989)&#44; Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of USSR (1989 to 1990)&#44; President of the Soviet Union (1990 to 1991),1104_1126 ,A3DD3ACPMVDVCA ,In the Java island of Indonesia&#44; more than 4 million people were utilized as forced laborers.,1149_249 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,AT&amp;T and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix variants on the market at that time: BSD&#44; System V&#44; and Xenix. This became Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4).[9]  On September 4&#44; 1991&#44; Sun announced that it would replace its existing BSD-derived Unix&#44; SunOS 4&#44; with one based on SVR4. This was identified internally as SunOS 5&#44; but a new marketing name was introduced at the same time: Solaris 2.[10] While SunOS 4.1.x micro releases were retroactively named Solaris 1 by Sun&#44; the Solaris name is almost exclusively used to refer to the SVR4-derived SunOS 5.0 and later.he justification for this new &quot;overbrand&quot; was that it encompassed not only SunOS&#44; but also the OpenWindows graphical user interface and Open Network Computing (ONC) functionality. The SunOS minor version is included in the Solaris release number; for example&#44; Solaris 2.4 incorporated SunOS 5.4.

One of the most important components is the kernel&#44; which controls low-level processes that the average user usually cannot see: it controls how memory is read and written&#44; the order in which processes are executed&#44; how information is received and sent by devices like the monitor&#44; keyboard and mouse&#44; and deciding how to interpret information received by networks. The user interface is a component that interacts with the computer user directly&#44; allowing them to control and use programs. The user interface may be graphical with icons and a desktop&#44; or textual&#44; with a command line. Application programming interfaces provide services and code libraries that let applications developers write modular code reusing well defined programming sequences in user space libraries or in the operating system itself. Which features are considered part of the operating system is defined differently in various operating systems.

In the same article Jenny Fry (a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute) commented on academics who cite Wikipedia&#44; saying that: &quot;You cannot say children are intellectually lazy because they are using the Internet when academics are using search engines in their research.

In some computer systems&#44; such as the original implementations of Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS&#44; the GUI is integrated into the kernel.  While technically a graphical user interface is not an operating system service&#44; incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are modular&#44; separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX&#44; VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way. GNU/Linux and Mac OS X are also built this way. Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user-space&#44; however versions between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003&#39;s graphics drawing routines exist mostly in kernel space. Windows 9x had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel.,13739_58 ,A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 ,It was said that even thogh the gods were defeated   they sustained further anyhow by some tricks.,1762_92 ,ADMENGADDLNDK ,&quot;Kama&quot;: Bodily&#44; sensual or worldly pleasures,28539_104 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,International calamities like the ship disaster of oil tanker ship&#44; Amoco Cadiz in 1978 on the shores of Brittany&#44; and Bhopal disaster in 1984 have shown the universality of such happenings&#44; and there is a need to try and address them in a decisive manner.  The boundariless nature of space and oceans has definitely increased the pollution on earth at the planetary level&#44; the issue of global worming is also related to this.

For want of enough practical data the effect of this group of chemicals is not understood well.

Often these resist direct reference or description&#44; with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance&#44; much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication&#44; which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also&#44; some groups emerged that considered themselves above the Sharia and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.  For these and other reasons&#44; the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars&#44; such as Al-Ghazali&#44; helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it.,7686_111 ,A3RS82XNENF2NT ,that is why every year regardless of the heart pain&#44;one must have ecg and treadmill tests done,53283_600 ,AI1HQO6HZCVT7 ,German Chancellor&#39;s official site (German and English),45708_109 ,A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST ,This position is not similar to anal sex.

The result of the project was OS/2&#44; but Microsoft and IBM disagreed on many important issues and eventually separated. OS/2 remained an IBM project. Microsoft started[citation needed] to work on Windows NT. The OS/2 file system HPFS contained several important new features. When Microsoft created their new operating system&#44; they borrowed many of these concepts for NTFS.[6] Probably as a result of this common ancestry&#44; HPFS and NTFS share the same disk partition identification type code (07). Sharing an ID is unusual since there were dozens of available codes&#44; and other major file systems have their own code. FAT has more than nine (one each for FAT12&#44; FAT16&#44; FAT32&#44; etc.). Algorithms which identify the file system in a partition type 07 must perform additional checks. It is also clear that NTFS owes some of its architectural design to Files-11 used by VMS. This is hardly surprising since Dave Cutler was the main lead for both VMS and Windows NT.,1474_183 ,A3VLXMS7W75XX4 ,This is a program where the news which comes in these media are discussed in blogs and news media.,84960_246 ,A1G9LNGGD9IP1X ,In every village&#44; goddesses will become much powerful.,2646_23 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,There are many types of mobile phones&#44; starting from the basic phone to the metamorphised phone like the musical phone and camera phone and smartphone.

Another solution is the linkage of all free clusters into one or more lists (as is done in Unix file systems). Instead&#44; the FAT has to be scanned as an array to find free clusters&#44; which can lead to performance penalties with large disks.  In fact&#44; computing free disk space on FAT is one of the most resource intensive operations&#44; as it requires reading the entire FAT linearly. A possible justification suggested by Microsoft&#39;s Raymond Chen for limiting the maximum size of FAT32 partitions created on Windows was the time required to perform a &quot;DIR&quot; operation&#44; which always displays the free disk space as the last line.[16] Displaying this line took longer and longer as the number of clusters increased.,7918_88 ,AQYLTGQE4K8FV ,Along with Subhashithas and Bethal stories a photo competition was being published since a decade.,1474_225 ,A3RS82XNENF2NT ,similar to all hobbies blogging also created its own words,2646_55 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,For example&#44; in Jamaica&#44; a AT&amp;T customer opted for an international service. Additional payment of 65 per minute can be made&#44; whereas a B-Mobile (Jamaica) customer has to pay for an equivalent international service /bin/sh.20 for every minute.  Some service providers focus on international sales&#44; whereas some others on regional sales.  For example&#44; The National Phone Company of Jamaica&#44; Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) Company&#39;s position is that the same B-phone customers spend less on local calls and more on international calls.  This difference is mainly because of the currency conversion&#44; because SIM card is purchased in local currency.  In America&#44; there is no competition for such services because some prominent service providers do not offer settle-when-you-quit service.

Radon (Rn) gas is a carcinogen&#44; which comes out of the earth at some places and spreads in the houses.  Formaldehyde (H2CO) gas is emitted from building materials like carpets and plywood.  While dryinig&#44; paints and solvents emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  Lead based paint can turn into dust and can go inside the body through breathing.  Deliberate air pollution is caused by air fresheners&#44; incense and other scented materials.  Smoke from the stoves in which wood is burnt in a controlled manner&#44; and from the fireplaces&#44; can add in considerable quantities to the inner and outer air&#44; the effect of smoking.

Post 1960&#44; this trend has been observed that stratosphere has only become cold.Reduction of stratospheric ozone leads to coolness&#44; but ozone depletion did not happen till the decade of 1970. Due to solar variation and volcanic activities from industrial age till 1950&#44; it did not become hot but has become cooler only. In 2006&#44; Peter Foukal and other astrophysicists from USA&#44; Germany and Switzerland found that in the last 1000 years there has been no net increase in sun&#39;s brightness. Due to solar cycle&#44; in the last 30 years there is increase of only 0.07 %.

The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphical&#44; audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers&#44; such as the Commodore 64&#44; and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The best selling model&#44; the Amiga 500&#44; was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe. In North America success was more modest. The Amiga went on to sell approximately six million units.[1] Second generation Amiga systems (A1200 and A4000) were released in 1992.

The most common free software license&#44; the GNU GPL&#44; is a form of copyleft&#44; and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the GNU project.
