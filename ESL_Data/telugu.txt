One of the most important components is the kernel&#44; which controls low-level processes that the average user usually cannot see: it controls how memory is read and written&#44; the order in which processes are executed&#44; how information is received and sent by devices like the monitor&#44; keyboard and mouse&#44; and deciding how to interpret information received by networks. The user interface is a component that interacts with the computer user directly&#44; allowing them to control and use programs. The user interface may be graphical with icons and a desktop&#44; or textual&#44; with a command line. Application programming interfaces provide services and code libraries that let applications developers write modular code reusing well defined programming sequences in user space libraries or in the operating system itself. Which features are considered part of the operating system is defined differently in various operating systems. For example&#44; Microsoft Windows considers its user interface to be part of the operating system&#44; while many versions of Linux do not.1149_1 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	In the early 1950s&#44; a computer could execute only one program at a time. Each user had sole use of the computer and would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards and tape. The program would be loaded into the machine&#44; and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights. It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine&#44; and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the Universal Turing machine.[citation needed]  Later machines came with libraries of software&#44; which would be linked to a user&#39;s program to assist in operations such as input and output and generating computer code from human-readable symbolic code. This was the genesis of the modern-day operating system. However&#44; machines still ran a single job at a time. At Cambridge University in England the job queue was at one time a washing line from which tapes were hung with different colored clothes-pegs to indicate job-priority.1149_2 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The user interface may be graphical with icons and a desktop&#44; or textual&#44; with a command line. Application programming interfaces provide services and code libraries that let applications developers write modular code reusing well defined programming sequences in user space libraries or in the operating system itself. Which features are considered part of the operating system is defined differently in various operating systems. For example&#44; Microsoft Windows considers its user interface to be part of the operating system&#44; while many versions of Linux do not.1149_3 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation&#44; the operating system acts as an intermediary between application programs and the computer hardware&#44;[1][2] although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware&#44; but will frequently call the OS or be interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on almost any device that contains a computerfrom cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers.1149_5 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Most of the modern computer systems support graphical user interfaces (GUI)&#44; and often include them. In some computer systems&#44; such as the original implementations of Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS&#44; the GUI is integrated into the kernel.  While technically a graphical user interface is not an operating system service&#44; incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are modular&#44; separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX&#44; VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way. GNU/Linux and Mac OS X are also built this way. Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user-space&#44; however versions between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003&#39;s graphics drawing routines exist mostly in kernel space. Windows 9x had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel.1149_6 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	The operating system was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0&#44; with a desktop-oriented version (Mac OS X v10.0) following in March 2001. Since then&#44; six more distinct &quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; editions of Mac OS X have been released&#44; the most recent being Mac OS X v10.6&#44; which was first made available on August 28&#44; 2009. Releases of Mac OS X are named after big cats; the current version of Mac OS X is &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;.  The server edition&#44; Mac OS X Server&#44; is architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart but usually runs on Apple&#39;s line of Macintosh server hardware. Mac OS X Server includes work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services&#44; including a mail transfer agent&#44; a Samba server&#44; an LDAP server&#44; a domain name server&#44; and others.1149_7 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	(users interface is done by the system  else there will be a lot of questions1149_9 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Embedded systems that have fixed deadlines use a real-time operating system such as VxWorks&#44; PikeOS&#44; eCos&#44; QNX&#44; MontaVista Linux and RTLinux. Windows CE is a real-time operating system that shares similar APIs to desktop Windows but shares none of desktop Windows&#39; codebase[citation needed]. Symbian OS also has an RTOS kernel (EKA2) starting with version 8.0b.  Some embedded systems use operating systems such as Palm OS&#44; BSD&#44; and GNU/Linux&#44; although such operating systems do not support real-time computing.1152_1 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	The great poet Sri Sri ruled the Telugu literature in the twentieth century.1152_2 	A2VAQFXBLP1HAF 	Srirangam SrinivasaRao is popularly known as SriSri1152_4 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	Sri Sri is a rational person and an athiest.1152_5 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	Sri sri was universally accepted as a great poet.1152_6 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	The poems that he created!1152_9 	AH5BVSXF5DYYD 	This made him to reach the top of literacy world..1201_1 	A3RS82XNENF2NT 	For trees&#44;animals&#44;humans to grow and survive on the earth&#44;water is the second most important factor reqired next to air1201_2 	A1Z53763UXALP 	The challenge faced by many countries around the world is of providing safe drinking water for its villages and cities.1201_3 	A1Z53763UXALP 	Irrigational water facilites are very important for agriculture.1201_4 	A1Z53763UXALP 	No industry can be established and run without proper water supply.1201_6 	A1Z53763UXALP 	The purest water available in nature is rain water.1201_8 	A1Z53763UXALP 	There are many usages for the word water in Telugu.1257_0 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Krishna Veni mother on the Prakasam bridge1257_2 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	In Coastal Andhra region&#44;

if we observe Telugu language&#44; Sanskrit seems to be Mother of Telugu.829_24 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Because the sound and the meaning are like that of Sanskrit.829_25 	AU7CIED3LX38J 	Like Sanskrit&#44;which has created a permanent place in Telugu literary world&#44; words from Persian and Urdu too have earned a place in day-to-day vocabulary of Telugu.829_26 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	It is true that no two Telugu people talk in Telugu without using a single word of English. All this is due to the influence of Britishers during their rule in India.829_28 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	Though Telugu people has good love towards English  words&#44; There is lot of distance between both the languages  according to Language science&#44; Tradition and Grammar.829_29 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	In Telugu sentence Noun-adjective-verb will come in   a sequence where in English they change the place and  will be in Noun-verb-adjective series.829_30 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	For those who speak in English&#44; Telugu word series  will be in opposite direction.829_31 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	Still many differences exists&#44; specially in past perfect  tense.829_33 	APDEI7F51RYRG 	telugu is one of the desciplined languages in the world.829_34 	A2TKVMEO33HP06 	In telugu sentences are very easy to understand &#44; and for the construction also it is very easy829_35 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	As it will end with vowels&#44; musically it is very  favorite language for musicians.829_36 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	Specially most of the ragas in Karnataka Music   is from Telugu language.829_38 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	Europeans belonging to the 19th century called   Telugu as &quot;Italian of the east&quot;.829_39 	A3T1KZYNIUW9IN 	The important point in telugu language(among other languages)is Sandhi829_40 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	When we join together two words and speak we will  get a new word.829_43 	A3RS82XNENF2NT 	apart from the all dravidian languages&#44;there are no satisfactory&#44;decisive evidences for the source of telugu languages829_44 	A3T1KZYNIUW9IN 	some telugu worde are in the beginning of the maharashtra prakrutha poem compilation &quot;gadhasaphtahaty&quot;created by sathavahana in 1 st century.829_45 	A3RS82XNENF2NT 	by this we can tell that people who speak telugu language used to stay between the areas of krishna and godavari rivers prior to the stavahanas829_46 	APDEI7F51RYRG 	Yanads were ancient people of telugu.829_48 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	Preliminary Dravidian languages history can be  taken back from few centuries BC&#44; but telugu  history can be traced only from 6th century AD829_49 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	The first and clear ancient inscription in Telugu belongs to 7th century.829_50 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	The first Telugu word found in the inscriptions is &#39;nagabu&#39;829_51 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	The earliest traces of Telugu are found in Prakrit context in inscriptions of the 11th century829_53 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	(given in the &quot;Telugu Talli&quot; anthology of poems collected by Dr. G.

they used run only single programs.1149_13 	AQYLTGQE4K8FV 	In 1960 the buyers of commercial computers used batch operations(which is also called &quot;Master Controller Program: or &quot;Supervisor&quot;)which are used to do operations faster and which can perform certain assigned jobs. For example HKho and controller data corporation and UNIVAC is brought into use.1149_14 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In the 1960s&#44; Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#44; AT&amp;T Bell Labs&#44; and General Electric developed an experimental operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.[2] Multics was highly innovative&#44; but had many problems.  Bell Labs&#44; frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims&#44; slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics&#44; Ken Thompson&#44; Dennis Ritchie&#44; M. D. McIlroy&#44; and J. F. Ossanna&#44;[3] decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. At the time&#44; Ritchie says &quot;What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming&#44; but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing&#44; as supplied by remote-access&#44; time-shared machines&#44; is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch&#44; but to encourage close communication.&quot;[3]  While Ken Thompson still had access to the Multics environment&#44; he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it. He also programmed a game called Space Travel&#44; but the game needed a more efficient and less expensive machine to run on&#44; and eventually a little-used PDP-7 at Bell Labs fit the bill.[4] On this PDP7&#44; a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie&#44; including Rudd Canaday&#44; developed a hierarchical file system&#44; the notions of computer processes and device files&#44; a command-line interpreter&#44; and some small utility programs1149_16 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The owner management systems were designed for company   hardware sale.1149_17 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories&#44; originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections&#44; but they had a fixed number of levels&#44; often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC&#39;s RSX-11M&#39;s &quot;group&#44; user&quot; hierarchy evolved into VMS directories&#44; CP/M&#39;s volumes evolved into MS-DOS 2.0+ subdirectories&#44; and HP&#39;s MPE group.account hierarchy and IBM&#39;s SSP and OS/400 library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.1149_18 	A1ROUGGGBWAQNP 	in 1960-70 UNIX has been included in PDP-7 and PDP-11 has introduced1149_19 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Unix provided the TCP/IP networking protocol on relatively inexpensive computers&#44; which contributed to the Internet explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity&#44; and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms. This also exposed numerous security holes in the networking implementations.  The Unix policy of extensive on-line documentation and (for many years) ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations&#44; and contributed to the 1983 launch of the free software movement.1149_21 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	MS-DOS grew from a 1981 request by IBM for an operating system for its IBM PC range of personal computers. Microsoft quickly bought the rights to QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System)&#44; also known as 86-DOS&#44;[1] from Seattle Computer Products&#44; and began work on modifying it to meet IBM&#39;s specification. The first edition&#44; MS-DOS 1.0&#44; was launched in 1982.[2] The version shipped with IBM&#39;s PCs was called PC DOS. Although MS-DOS and PC-DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM&#44; the two products eventually went their separate ways.1149_22 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	This design would have worked well for compatibility&#44; if application programs had only used MS-DOS services to perform device I/O&#44; and indeed the same design philosophy is embodied in Windows NT (see Hardware Abstraction Layer). However&#44; in MS-DOS&#39;s early days&#44; the greater speed attainable by programs through direct control of hardware was of particular importance&#44; especially for games&#44; which often pushed the limits of their contemporary hardware. Very soon an IBM-compatible architecture became the goal&#44; and before long all 8086-family computers closely emulated IBM&#39;s hardware&#44; and only a single version of MS-DOS for a fixed hardware platform was needed for the market. This version is the version of MS-DOS that is discussed here&#44; as the dozens of other OEM versions of &quot;MS-DOS&quot; were only relevant to the systems they were designed for&#44; and in any case were very similar in function and capability to the same-numbered standard version for the IBM PC&#44; with a few notable exceptions.1149_23 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	There is a small difference between ms-dos and pc-dos.For example GW-BASIC is with MS-DOS.(It is because In IBm pc ROm some basic codes putting is not lawful in computers )1149_24 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	MS-DOS grew from a 1981 request by IBM for an operating system for its IBM PC range of personal computers.

The first edition&#44; MS-DOS 1.0&#44; was launched in 1982.[2] The version shipped with IBM&#39;s PCs was called PC DOS. Although MS-DOS and PC-DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM&#44; the two products eventually went their separate ways.1149_26 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	MS-DOS had grown in spurts&#44; with many significant features being taken or duplicated from Microsoft&#39;s other products and operating systems. MS-DOS also grew by incorporating&#44; by direct licensing or feature duplicating&#44; the functionality of tools and utilities developed by independent companies&#44; such as Norton Utilities&#44; PC Tools (Microsoft Anti-Virus)&#44; QEMM expanded memory manager&#44; Stacker disk compression&#44; and others.1149_27 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In the business world the 808x-based machines that MS-DOS was tied to faced competition from the Unix operating system which ran on many different hardware architectures. Microsoft itself sold a version of Unix for the PC called Xenix.1149_28 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	For their unique customer and as an   alternative to ms-dos management system&#44; the Microsoft had  made business like a multi customer.1149_29 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	A new line of Windows&#44; (Windows NT)&#44; boot through a kernel whose sole purpose is to load Windows: there is no character-mode boot similar to Consumer Windows&#44; OS/2 or UNIX). The console runs as a Win32 session&#44; with the default processor cmd.exe being a feature-reduced version of OS/2&#39;s version. The command session permits running of various supported command line utilities from Win32&#44; MS-DOS&#44; OS/2 1.x and POSIX.1149_31 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Even so&#44; software mistakes are detected as it is implemented in 286&#44; and it did not get acceptance till the release of Intel 80386.1149_32 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	As PC code 386 BSD was easy with Unix&#44; many systens like Unix (then coded as &quot;*NIX*&quot;)&#44; and Linux came into vogue.  But&#44; IBM (and initially Microsoft) chose OS/2 from the start of PS/2.  Microsoft&#44; on its own&#44; after DOS&#44;  designed Microsoft Windows initially like GUI&#44; then modified it to a full operating system.1149_33 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Traditional Mac OS and Microsoft Windows 1.0-3.11 support only cooperative multitask operations (only while imlementing 32-bit versions&#44; Windows 95&#44; 98&#44; &amp; ME support the multi-task operations&#44; but traditionally 16-bit versions are implemented in cooperative multitask operations)&#44; and they are very limited in their capacity to use memory protection facility.1149_34 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In an effort towards compatibility&#44; in 1999 several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4&#39;s Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.  The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems&#44; particularly Linux.1149_36 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The runtime task resources are not properly incorporated for Classic Amiga OS&#44; which came from Windows Me through Windows 1.0&#44; and for Microsoft Windows versions.1149_37 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	If the task has to be ended&#44; resources are not released till the machine is started for new programs.1149_38 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphical&#44; audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers&#44; such as the Commodore 64&#44; and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The best selling model&#44; the Amiga 500&#44; was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe. In North America success was more modest. The Amiga went on to sell approximately six million units.[1] Second generation Amiga systems (A1200 and A4000) were released in 1992. However&#44; failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems and poor marketing meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms&#44; such as the game consoles and IBM PC compatibles.1149_41 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	OS/360&#44; officially known as IBM System/360 Operating System&#44;[1][2] was a batch processing operating system developed by IBM for their then-new System/360 mainframe computer&#44; announced in 1964; it was heavily influenced by the earlier IBSYS/IBJOB and Input/Output Control System (IOCS) packages. It was among the earliest operating systems to make direct access storage devices a prerequisite for their operation.  IBM announced three different levels of OS/360&#44; generated from the same tapes and sharing most of their code. IBM eventually renamed these options and made some significant design changes:1149_42 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	IBM originally intended that System/360 should have only one batch-oriented operating system&#44; OS/360.[4] It also intended to supply a separate timesharing operating system&#44; TSS/360. There are at least two accounts of why IBM eventually decided to produce other&#44; simpler batch-oriented operating systems: because it found that OS/360 would not fit into the limited memory available on the smaller System/360 models1149_43 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	There are at least two accounts of why IBM eventually decided to produce other&#44; simpler batch-oriented operating systems: because it found that OS/360 would not fit into the limited memory available on the smaller System/360 models;1149_44 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	os/360 had also directed for  many feelings&gt;some of them   could not be seen outside the mainframe.1149_46 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	whenever work is stopped because of any reason the resources management system will start working again.1149_47 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	TSS/360 was so late and unreliable that IBM canceled it&#44; although IBM later supplied three releases of the TSS/370 PRPQ. By this time CP-67 was running well enough for IBM to offer it &quot;without warranty&quot; as a timesharing facility for a few large customers1149_48 	AN9IFNKPF7N1I 	For the Bayatch processing to developed SCOPE production system controll data corporation with the help Universityof Minnesota.1149_49 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	When System/370 was announced in 1970 it offered essentially the same facilities as System/360 but with about 4 times the processor speeds of similarly-priced System/360 CPUs.[18] Then in 1972 IBM announced &quot;System/370 Advanced Functions&quot;&#44; of which the main item was that future sales of System/370 would include virtual memory capability and this could also be retro-fitted to existing System/370 CPUs. Hence IBM also committed to delivering enhanced operating systems which could support the use of virtual memory.1149_51 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Plato was remarkably innovative for its time&#44; featuring real-time chat&#44; and multi-user graphical games.1149_52 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Burroughs Corporation introduced the B5000 in 1961 with the MCP&#44; (Master Control Program) operating system.1149_53 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	The B5000 was a stack machine designed to exclusively support high-level languages with no machine language or assembler&#44; and indeed the MCP was the first OS to be written exclusively in a high-level language  ESPOL&#44; a dialect of ALGOL. MCP also introduced many other ground-breaking innovations&#44; such as being the first commercial implementation of virtual memory.1149_54 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	During development of the AS400&#44; IBM made an approach to Burroughs to licence MCP to run on the AS400 hardware.1149_56 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	MCP is still in use today in the Unisys  ClearPath/MCP  line of computers.1149_57 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	UNIVAC&#44; the first commercial computer manufacturer&#44; produced a series of EXEC operating systems.1149_58 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Like all early main-frame systems&#44; this was a batch-oriented system that managed magnetic drums&#44; disks&#44; card readers and line printers.1149_59 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	In 1970s&#44; to support large-scale time sharing&#44; UNIVAC manufactured Real-Time Basic (RTB) system.  It also made a model of Dratmouth BASIC system.1149_61 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	After Honeywell acquired it&#44; it was renamed as General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS).1149_62 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	Digital Equipment Corporation developed multiple operating systems for its various computer sections&#44; also TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 time-sharing systems for the 36-bit PDP-10 class systems.1149_63 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	Before the widespread use of UNIX&#44; TOPS-10 system was popular in universities and in early ARPANET communities.1149_64 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	From the 1960s though the 1970s&#44; software that runs on more than one system have entered or many hardware capabilities evolved that allowed this.1149_66 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	In fact most 360&#39;s after the 360/40 (except 360/165 and 360/168) would get micro programmed and implemented.1149_67 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	But soon after other means of achieving application compatibility were proven.1149_68 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	The huge investment in software made till 1960 caused the original computer manufacturers to develop compatible operating system along with the hardware.1149_69 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	Notable ones having mainframe operating systems:1149_71 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	IBM OS/360 - IBM System/360&#44; 1966 to IBM z/OS&#44; Incorp.1149_72 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	IBM CP-67 - IBM System/360&#44; 1967 to IBM z/VM&#44; Incorp.1149_73 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	UNIVAC EXEC 8 - UNIVAC 1108&#44; 1964 TO UNISYS CLEARPATH/MCP&#44; Incorp.1149_76 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	A first disc-based recognisable operating system is CP/M; with the very early microcomputural help&#44; this is very closely imitated in MS-DOS.

In this way as it has many different usages and meanings&#44; as it is identified with many complex feelings&#44; it is difficult to commonly define love and also to compare it with situations of other feelings.45247_3 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Love is a delicately preserved deep unspelt feeling towards another person&#44; it is a perennial matter.  This little feeling of love also&#44; joins the fund of many types of other feelings&#44; from love filled with lust and strong yearning&#44; from family type&#44; platonic love of emotional nearness not related with sex&#44; to religious love of philosophical oneness or worship.45247_4 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Love in its various forms plays a prominent role in the relationships between persons and also becomes the centre of prominence for uncertain mental state&#44; all this is quite common fundamental concept in creative arts.45247_7 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	The word &quot;love&quot; can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Often&#44; other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that English relies mainly on &quot;love&quot; to encapsulate; one example is the plurality of Greek words for &quot;love.&quot; Cultural differences in conceptualizing love thus make it doubly difficult to establish any universal definition45247_8 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Although the nature or essence of love is a subject of frequent debate&#44; different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what isn&#39;t  love.45247_9 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of like)&#44; love is commonly contrasted with hate (or neutral apathy); as a less sexual and more emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment&#44; love is commonly contrasted with lust; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones&#44;4531_11 	A2VAQFXBLP1HAF 	We should not get what we want through violence.4531_12 	A2VAQFXBLP1HAF 	A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new-   Scientist Albert Einstein4531_13 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	Martin Luther King - Jesus gave me the message&#44;and Gandhi showed it in action4531_16 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	In 1886&#44; Gandhi with his elder brother Lakshmidas (Person to the right)4531_17 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	Gandhi as a Student of Law in London.4531_20 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	His father&#39;s name is Karamchand Gandhi.4531_22 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	They are a traditional family.4531_23 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi as a boy used to be very slow.4531_25 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	As per tradition in those days&#44; he was married to Kastur Bai when he was 13 years old.4531_26 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	They had four children (Harilal Gandhi&#44; Manilal Gandhi&#44; Ramdas Gandhi&#44; Devdas Gandhi) Gandhi used to be a mediocre student.4531_27 	APDEI7F51RYRG 	He studied at porebandhar and rajkote.4531_28 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	At the age of 19 (in 1888)&#44; Gandhi went to England to study law.4531_30 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	He had the introduction with famous persons like bernad shah4531_31 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	he had studied many holy religious books.4531_32 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	During these times&#44; his education&#44; personality and thought process were taken a shape.

This ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already used by another program.1149_122 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Since programs time share&#44; each program must have independent access to memory.1149_123 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Cooperative memory management&#44; used by many early operating systems assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the kernel&#39;s memory manager&#44; and do not exceed their allocated memory. This system of memory management is almost never seen anymore&#44; since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory.1149_124 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	If a program fails it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or overwritten1149_126 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	With cooperative memory management it takes only one misbehaved program to crash the system.1149_127 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Memory protection enables the kernel to limit a process&#39; access to the computer&#39;s memory.1149_128 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Various methods of memory protection exist&#44; including memory segmentation and paging.1149_129 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	All methods require some level of hardware support (such as the 80286 MMU) which doesn&#39;t exist in all computers.1149_131 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Attempts to access other addresses will trigger an interrupt which will cause the CPU to re-enter supervisor mode&#44; placing the kernel in charge.1149_132 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	This is called a segmentation violation or Seg-V for short&#44; and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation&#44; and because it is usually a sign of a misbehaving program&#44; the kernel will generally resort to terminating the offending program&#44; and will report the error.1149_133 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Windows 3.1-Me had some level of memory protection&#44; but programs could easily circumvent the need to use it.1149_134 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Under Windows 9x all MS-DOS applications ran in supervisor mode&#44; giving them almost unlimited control over the computer1149_136 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Many types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are also available for Linux.

Currently&#44; over three hundred distributions are actively developed&#44; with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use1149_139 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	If a program tries to access memory that isn&#39;t in its current range of accessible memory&#44; but nonetheless has been allocated to it&#44; the kernel will be interrupted in the same way as it would if the program were to exceed its allocated memory.1149_141 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	An exokernel is a type of kernel that does not abstract hardware into theoretical models. Instead it allocates physical hardware resources&#44; such as processor time&#44; memory pages&#44; and disk blocks&#44; to different programs. A program running on an exokernel can link to a library operating system that uses the exokernel to simulate the abstractions of a well-known OS&#44; or it can develop application-specific abstractions for better performance1149_142 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	This gives the control for the kernel applications.  Even the selection is not done there it will be applied.1149_143 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In modern management system&#44;frequently the application of   information is temporarily stored on the disk.or any other media makes the region useful for the use of other programs.1149_144 	AN9IFNKPF7N1I 	It is also called the reverse process&#44; the place of the memory used to the multi programs and to reverse the request of the that place.1149_146 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Multifunction management means processing many independent different applications on a single computer.It seems to execute different applications in a single time.1149_147 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Other systems (particularly on smaller&#44; less powerful computers) may provide co-operative multitasking&#44; where each process is allowed to run uninterrupted until it makes a special request that tells the kernel it may switch to another process. Such requests are known as &quot;yielding&quot;&#44; and typically occur in response to requests for interprocess communication&#44; or for waiting for an event to occur. Older versions of Windows and Mac OS both used co-operative multitasking but switched to pre-emptive schemes as the power of the computers to which they were targeted grew1149_148 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Multi-tasking kernels are able to give the user the illusion that the number of processes being run simultaneously on the computer is higher than the maximum number of processes the computer is physically able to run simultaneously. Typically&#44; the number of processes a system may run simultaneously is equal to the number of CPUs installed (however this may not be the case if the processors support simultaneous multithreading).1149_149 	AN9IFNKPF7N1I 	After some time control are again given to the kernel through the machines and another program permitted to the CPU.1149_151 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The first model which allocates time to the programs is called cooperative multitask maintenance.1149_152 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	In this model&#44; when the comand is sent from the Kernel to the program&#44; before the command is clearly returned to the kernel&#44; it is implemented.1149_153 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	That means&#44; apart from preventing any program from the CPU&#44; which is harmful or badly implementable&#44; by introducing unlimited matter&#44; it stops the work of the entire system1149_154 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The policy of the invasive multitask maintenance is to allot time of the CPU to all the programs in an orderly way.1149_156 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	(for problems and operations in the two modes&#44; look at the divisions above).1149_157 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Cooperative multitask maintenance is available in required magnitude on many personal customers maintenance systems&#44; because home computers generally use few programs which are tested well.1149_158 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Windows NT is the first version of Microsoft Windows.  This implements the invasory multitask maintenance.   But till Windows XP arrives&#44; it cannot reach the market of the home based customers.1149_159 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	(As Windows NT has targeted the trade professionals)1149_161 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In these recent years the needs have increased because the long time secrets frequently made friendship with  some kernal performs.some times they are built with 100ms or some other bigger single constructions.1149_162 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Windows Vista is an operating system released in several variations developed by Microsoft for use on personal computers&#44; including home and business desktops&#44; laptops&#44; tablet PCs&#44; and media center PCs. Prior to its announcement on July 22&#44; 2005&#44; Windows Vista was known by its codename &quot;Longhorn.&quot;[4] Development was completed on November 8&#44; 2006; over the following three months it was released in stages to computer hardware and software manufacturers&#44; business customers&#44; and retail channels. On January 30&#44; 2007&#44; it was released worldwide&#44;[5] and was made available for purchase and download from Microsoft&#39;s website.[6] The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor&#44; Windows XP&#44; the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems. It was succeeded by Windows 7 which was released to manufacturing on July 22&#44; 2009&#44; and for the general public on October 22&#44; 2009.1149_163 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Windows Vista contains many changes and new features&#44; including an updated graphical user interface and visual style dubbed Aero&#44; a redesigned search function&#44; multimedia tools including Windows DVD Maker&#44; and redesigned networking&#44; audio&#44; print&#44; and display sub-systems. Vista aims to increase the level of communication between machines on a home network&#44; using peer-to-peer technology to simplify sharing files and media between computers and devices. Windows Vista includes version 3.0 of the .NET Framework&#44; allowing software developers to write applications without traditional Windows APIs.1149_164 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	prior releases of Windows supported per-file encryption using Encrypting File System&#44; the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista include BitLocker Drive Encryption which can protect entire volumes&#44; notably the operating system volume. However&#44; BitLocker requires approximately a 1.5-gigabyte partition to be permanently unencrypted and to contain system files in order for Windows to boot. In normal circumstances&#44; the only time this partition is accessed is when the computer is booting&#44; or when there is a Windows update that changes files in this area which is a legitimate reason to access this section of the drive. The area can be a potential security issue&#44; because a hexadecimal editor (such as dskprobe.exe)&#44; or malicious software running with administrator and/or kernel level privileges would be able to write to this &quot;Ghost Partition&quot; and allow a piece of malicious software to compromise the system&#44; or disable the encryption. BitLocker can work in conjunction with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cryptoprocessor (version 1.2) embedded in a computer&#39;s motherboard&#44; or with a USB key.[38] However&#44; as with other full disk encryption technologies&#44; BitLocker is vulnerable to a cold boot attack&#44; especially where TPM is used as a key protector without a boot PIN being required too1149_167 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The central feature is that reading the whole information stored in management systems.1149_168 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	It stores the files using them on computer disks.They are definite path constructions  and fast having high confidentiality and devices.They permit to use the outside place  for more consumption.1149_169 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The storing of files in a definite ways is known as file system.It permits for many other characteristics.1149_171 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Early operating systems generally supported a single type of disk drive and only one kind of file system.1149_172 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Early file systems were limited in their capacity&#44; speed&#44; and in the kinds of file names and directory structures they could use1149_173 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Unix was designed to be portable&#44; multi-tasking and multi-user in a time-sharing configuration. Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of plain text for storing data; a hierarchical file system; treating devices and certain types of inter-process communication (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of software tools&#44; small programs that can be strung together through a command line interpreter using pipes&#44; as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality. These concepts are collectively known as the Unix philosophy.1149_174 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	While many simpler operating systems support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems&#44; operating systems like UNIX and GNU/Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS. An operating system like UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices&#44; regardless of their design or file systems to be accessed through a common application programming interface (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers.1149_176 	AN9IFNKPF7N1I 	The instrument chodakam drive&#39;s understand the particulaar language and spread to the disc drives of the production organizations and translated to the national language. in unix this is the problems of the instrument&#39;s language.1149_177 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	When the kernel has an appropriate device driver in place&#44; it can then access the contents of the disk drive in raw format&#44; which may contain one or more file systems.1149_178 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file systems.1149_179 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Programs can then deal with these file systems on the basis of filenames&#44; and directories/folders&#44; contained within a hierarchical structure.1149_181 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Various differences between file systems make supporting all file systems difficult.1149_182 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Allowed characters in file names&#44; case sensitivity&#44; and the presence of various kinds of file attributes makes the implementation of a single interface for every file system a daunting task.1149_183 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Operating systems tend to recommend using (and so support natively) file systems specifically designed for them; for example&#44; NTFS in Windows and ext3  and ReiserFS  in GNU/Linux.1149_184 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	However&#44; in practice&#44; third party drives are usually available to give support for the most widely used file systems in most general-purpose operating systems (for example&#44; NTFS is available in GNU/Linux through NTFS-3g&#44; and ext2/3 and ReiserFS are available in Windows through FS-driver and rfstool).1149_186 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	A device driver is a specific type of computer software developed to allow interaction with hardware devices1149_187 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device&#44; through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware is connected to&#44; providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device&#44; and on the other end&#44; the requisite interfaces to the operating system and software applications1149_188 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	It is a specialized hardware-dependent computer program which is also operating system specific that enables another program&#44; typically an operating system or applications software package or computer program running under the operating system kernel&#44; to interact transparently with a hardware device&#44; and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interfacing needs.1149_189 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	The key design goal of device drivers is abstraction. Every model of hardware (even within the same class of device) is different1149_191 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Computers and their operating systems cannot be expected to know how to control every device&#44; both now and in the future. To solve this problem&#44; operative systems essentially dictate how every type of device should be controlled. The function of the device driver is then to translate these operative system mandated function calls into device specific calls.1149_192 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	In theory a new device&#44; which is controlled in a new manner&#44; should function correctly if a suitable driver is available. This new driver will ensure that the device appears to operate as usual from the operating system&#39;s point of view.1149_194 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Currently most operating systems support a variety of networking protocols&#44; hardware&#44; and applications for using them1149_196 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently&#44; such as SSH  which allows networked users direct access to a computer&#39;s command line interface.1149_197 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Client/server networking involves a program on a computer somewhere which connects via a network to another computer&#44; called a server1149_198 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Servers offer (or host) various services to other network computers and users.1149_199 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program&#44; which is responsible for handling requests to that port.1149_201 	A1G9LNGGD9IP1X 	One or many protocols work for the different administrative associations. For example&#44; SNA fir IBM&#44; DECnet for digital equipment corporation and Microsoft(SMB) for windows.1149_202 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	For file usage ntfs is used&#44;specific works are done with specific protocols.Version 2.2 (released 26 January 1999)[57] removed the global spinlock and provided improved SMP support&#44; and added support for the m68k and PowerPC architectures as well as new filesystems (including read-only support for Microsofts NTFS filesystem)1149_204 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The computer security depends on howmany securities are working.Using external resources fromthe kernel through network and to process the softwares modern devices are being used.1149_206 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The standards method is needed for the recognization.1149_207 	A1G9LNGGD9IP1X 	All the client&#39;s names are registered and each is given a login id.1149_208 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The process of attaching a magnetic stripe to a plastic card was invented by IBM under a contract with the US government for a security system. Forrest Parry&#44; an IBM Engineer&#44; had the idea of securing a piece of magnetic tape&#44; the predominant storage medium at the time&#44; to a plastic card base. He became frustrated because every adhesive he tried produced unacceptable results. The tape strip either warped or its characteristics were affected by the adhesive&#44; rendering the tape strip unusable. After a frustrating day in the laboratory&#44; trying to get the right adhesive&#44; he came home with several pieces of magnetic tape and several plastic cards. As he walked in the door at home&#44; his wife was ironing and watching TV. She immediately saw the frustration on his face and asked what was wrong. He explained the source of his frustration: inability to get the tape to &quot;stick&quot; to the plastic in a way that would work. She said&#44; &quot;Here&#44; let me try the iron.&quot; She did and the problem was solved. The heat of the iron was just high enough to bond the tape to the card.There were a number of steps required to convert the magnetic striped media into an industry acceptable device. These steps included: 1) Creating the international standards for stripe record content&#44; including which information&#44; in what format&#44; and using which defining codes. 2) Field testing the proposed device and standards for market acceptance. 3) Developing the manufacturing steps needed to mass produce the large number of cards required. 4) Adding stripe issue and acceptance capabilities to available equipment. These steps were initially managed by Jerome Svigals of the Advanced Systems Division of IBM&#44; Los Gatos&#44; California from 1966 to 1975.1149_209 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Magstripes following these specifications can typically be read by most point-of-sale hardware&#44; which are simply general-purpose computers that can be programmed to perform specific tasks. Examples of cards adhering to these standards include ATM cards&#44; bank cards (credit and debit cards including VISA and MasterCard)&#44; gift cards&#44; loyalty cards&#44; driver&#39;s licenses&#44; telephone cards&#44; membership cards&#44; electronic benefit transfer cards (e.g. food stamps)&#44; and nearly any application in which value or secure information is not stored on the card itself. Many video game and amusement centers now use debit card systems based on magnetic stripe cards.  Magnetic stripe cloning can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature known as a MagnePrint or BluPrint can be used in conjunction with common two factor authentication schemes utilized in ATM&#44; debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.[2][3]  Counterexamples of cards which intentionally ignore ISO standards include hotel key cards&#44; most subway and bus cards&#44; and some national prepaid calling cards (such as for the country of Cyprus) in which the balance is stored and maintained directly on the stripe and not retrieved from a remote database.1149_211 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	whenever computer gets outward request &#44;they will assembled through network console and login even the outward security is needed.1149_212 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	The external requests are often being sent to the managed system Kernels through search tools&#44; will be sent   to the application centers or being sent directly.

Areas of improvement include file copy operations&#44; hibernation&#44; logging off on domain-joined machines&#44; JavaScript parsing in Internet Explorer&#44; network file share browsing&#44;[68] Windows Explorer ZIP file handling&#44;[71] and Windows Disk Defragmenter.[72] The ability to choose individual drives to defragment is being reintroduced as well1149_222 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	While these new features and security improvements have garnered positive reviews&#44; Vista has also been the target of much criticism and negative press. Criticism of Windows Vista has targeted its high system requirements&#44; its more restrictive licensing terms&#44; the inclusion of a number of new digital rights management technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media&#44; lack of compatibility with some pre-Vista hardware and software&#44; and the number of authorization prompts for User Account Control. As a result of these and other issues&#44; Windows Vista had seen initial adoption and satisfaction rates lower than Windows XP.[9] However&#44; with an estimated 330 million Internet users as of January 2009&#44; it had been announced that Vista usage had surpassed Microsofts pre-launch two-year-out expectations of achieving 200 million users.[10][11] At the release of Windows 7 (October 2009)&#44; Windows Vista (with approximately 400 million Internet users) was the second most widely used operating system on the Internet with an approximately 18.6% market share&#44; the most widely used being Windows XP with an approximately 63.3% market share.[12] As of May 2010&#44; Windows Vista&#39;s market share estimates range from 15.26% to 26.04%1149_224 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	windows 9x consists of many firewalls.but they don&#39;t have entry .ths these are the real management systems.1149_225 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	along with this only the security system is allowed.1149_227 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	Microsoft developed Windows 3.1&#44; which included several minor improvements to Windows 3.0&#44; but primarily consisted of bugfixes and multimedia support. It also excluded support for Real mode&#44; and only ran on an 80286 or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11&#44; a touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992.    Meanwhile Microsoft continued to develop Windows NT. The main architect of the system was Dave Cutler&#44; one of the chief architects of VMS at Digital Equipment Corporation (later purchased by Compaq&#44; now part of Hewlett-Packard).[4] Microsoft hired him in August 1988 to create a successor to OS/2&#44; but Cutler created a completely new system instead.1149_228 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	User Account Control&#44; or UAC is perhaps the most significant and visible of these changes. UAC is a security technology that makes it possible for users to use their computer with fewer privileges by default&#44; with a view to stopping malware from making unauthorized changes to the system. This was often difficult in previous versions of Windows&#44; as the previous &quot;limited&quot; user accounts proved too restrictive and incompatible with a large proportion of application software&#44; and even prevented some basic operations such as looking at the calendar from the notification tray. In Windows Vista&#44; when an action is performed that requires administrative rights (such as installing/uninstalling software or making system-wide configuration changes)&#44; the user is first prompted for an administrator name and password1149_229 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	In September 2000&#44; Microsoft introduced Windows Me (Millennium Edition)&#44; which upgraded Windows 98 with enhanced multimedia and Internet features. It also introduced the first version of system restore&#44; which allowed users to revert their system state to a previous &quot;known-good&quot; point in the case of system failure. The first version of Windows Movie Maker was introduced as well.    Windows Me was conceived as a quick one-year project that served as a stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows XP. Many of the new features were available from the Windows Update site as updates for older Windows versions. As a result&#44; Windows Me was not acknowledged as a unique Operating System along the lines of 95 or 98&#44; and is often included in the Windows 9x series.1149_230 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	Microsoft continued to support the use of the Windows 9x series&#44; however&#44; until July 11&#44; 2006&#44; when extended support ended for the software.[10]    Microsoft DirectX&#44; a set of standard gaming APIs&#44; stopped being updated on Windows 95 at Version 8.0a.[11] Windows 98 and ME stopped being updated at version 9&#44; and DirectX 10 ships with and is only available with Windows Vista and later; previous versions of Windows are not able to officially run DirectX 10-exclusive applications.1149_232 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open source software collaboration; typically all the underlying source code can be used&#44; freely modified&#44; and redistributed&#44; both commercially and non-commercially&#44; by anyone under licenses such as the GNU General Public License. Typically Linux is packaged in a format known as a Linux distribution for desktop and server use. Linux distributions include the Linux kernel and all of the supporting software required to run a complete system&#44; such as utilities and libraries&#44; the X Window System&#44; the GNOME and KDE desktop environments&#44; and the Apache HTTP Server. Commonly used applications with desktop Linux systems include the Mozilla Firefox web-browser&#44; the OpenOffice.org office application suite and the GIMP image editor.  The name &quot;Linux&quot; comes from the Linux kernel&#44; originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. The main supporting user space system tools and libraries from the GNU Project (announced in 1983 by Richard Stallman) are the basis for the Free Software Foundation&#39;s preferred name GNU/Linux.[1149_234 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open source software. Linux is not the only such operating system&#44; although it is by far the most widely used.[44] Some free and open source software licenses are based on the principle of copyleft&#44; a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most common free software license&#44; the GNU GPL&#44; is a form of copyleft&#44; and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the GNU project.  Linux based distributions are intended by developers for interoperability with other operating systems and established computing standards. Linux systems adhere to POSIX&#44;[45] SUS&#44;[46] ISO&#44; and ANSI standards where possible&#44; although to date only one Linux distribution has been POSIX.1 certified&#44; Linux-FT.1149_235 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In many cities and regions&#44; local associations known as Linux Users Groups (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations&#44; training&#44; technical support&#44; and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open source projects have IRC chatrooms or newsgroups. Online forums are another means for support&#44; with notable examples being LinuxQuestions.org and the Gentoo forums. Linux distributions host mailing lists; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.  There are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print magazines on Linux often include cover disks including software or even complete Linux distributions1149_236 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Many types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are also available for Linux. Commonly&#44; either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system&#44; or that application will have a version that works on Linux (such as Skype). Furthermore&#44; the Wine project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. CrossOver is a proprietary solution based on the open source Wine project that supports running Windows versions of Microsoft Office&#44; Intuit applications such as Quicken and QuickBooks&#44; Adobe Photoshop versions through CS2&#44; and many popular games such as World of Warcraft and Team Fortress 2. In other cases&#44; where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as desktop publishing[57] and professional audio&#44;1149_238 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	For more information see Linux/method and for vista   consumer control and applications compare the characteristics.1149_239 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	Support for modern file system1149_240 	AN9IFNKPF7N1I 	The support of the all modern production organization used the one type of the file productions and the support is different to the file organizations.1149_242 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	OpenSolaris is a relatively recent addition to the list of operating systems based on free software licenses marked as such by FSF and OSI. It includes a number of derivatives that combines CDDL-licensed kernel and system tools and also GNU userland and is currently the only open source System V derivative available.The dot-com bubble (20012003) led to significant consolidation of versions of Unix. Of the many commercial variants of Unix that were born in the 1980s&#44; only Solaris&#44; HP-UX&#44; and AIX were still doing relatively well in the market&#44; though SGI&#39;s IRIX persisted for quite some time. Of these&#44; Solaris had the largest market share in 20051149_244 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	The booted veritas VXFS was joined in the all workable  kernel.1149_245 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In solaris 7 for UFS logging or journaling has combined.solaris 10&#44;solaris Express&#44;open solaris are the free   mother reforms of solaris supported the booted ZFS.1149_246 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Solaris is known for its scalability&#44; especially on SPARC systems&#44; and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace&#44; ZFS and Time Slider.[2][3] Solaris supports SPARC-based and x86-based workstations and servers from Sun and other vendors&#44; with efforts underway to port to additional platforms. Solaris is certified against the Single Unix Specification.1149_249 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	AT&amp;T and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix variants on the market at that time: BSD&#44; System V&#44; and Xenix. This became Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4).[9]  On September 4&#44; 1991&#44; Sun announced that it would replace its existing BSD-derived Unix&#44; SunOS 4&#44; with one based on SVR4. This was identified internally as SunOS 5&#44; but a new marketing name was introduced at the same time: Solaris 2.[10] While SunOS 4.1.x micro releases were retroactively named Solaris 1 by Sun&#44; the Solaris name is almost exclusively used to refer to the SVR4-derived SunOS 5.0 and later.he justification for this new &quot;overbrand&quot; was that it encompassed not only SunOS&#44; but also the OpenWindows graphical user interface and Open Network Computing (ONC) functionality. The SunOS minor version is included in the Solaris release number; for example&#44; Solaris 2.4 incorporated SunOS 5.4. After Solaris 2.6&#44; Sun dropped the &quot;2.&quot; from the number&#44; so Solaris 7 incorporates SunOS 5.7&#44; and the latest release SunOS 5.10 forms the core of Solaris 10.1149_252 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	As of Windows Vista&#44; applications can use Transactional NTFS to group changes to files together into a transaction. The transaction will guarantee that all changes happen&#44; or none of them do&#44; and it will guarantee that applications outside the transaction will not see the changes until they are committed.[24]  It uses the similar techniques as those used for Volume Shadow Copies (i.e. copy-on-write) to ensure that overwritten data can be safely rolled back&#44; and a CLFS log to mark the transactions that have still not been committed&#44; or those that have been committed but still not fully applied (in case of system crash during a commit by one of the participants).  Transactional NTFS does not restrict transactions to just the local NTFS volume&#44; but also includes other transactional data or operations in other locations such as data stored in separate volumes&#44; the local registry&#44; or SQL databases&#44; or the current states of system services or remote services.1149_253 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	As of Windows Vista&#44; applications can use Transactional NTFS to group changes to files together into a transaction.

The GPL-licensed NTFS-3G also works on Mac OS X through FUSE and allows reading and writing to NTFS partitions. A performance enhanced commercial version&#44; called Tuxera NTFS for Mac[31]&#44; is also available from the NTFS-3G developers. NTFS write support has been discovered in Mac OS X 10.6&#44; but has not been activated as of version 10.6.1&#44; although hacks do exist to enable the functionality. However&#44; user reports indicate the functionality is unstable and tends to cause kernel panics&#44; probably the reason why write support has not been enabled or advertised1149_256 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Microsoft and IBM formed a joint project to create the next generation of graphical operating system. The result of the project was OS/2&#44; but Microsoft and IBM disagreed on many important issues and eventually separated. OS/2 remained an IBM project. Microsoft started[citation needed] to work on Windows NT. The OS/2 file system HPFS contained several important new features. When Microsoft created their new operating system&#44; they borrowed many of these concepts for NTFS.[6] Probably as a result of this common ancestry&#44; HPFS and NTFS share the same disk partition identification type code (07). Sharing an ID is unusual since there were dozens of available codes&#44; and other major file systems have their own code. FAT has more than nine (one each for FAT12&#44; FAT16&#44; FAT32&#44; etc.). Algorithms which identify the file system in a partition type 07 must perform additional checks. It is also clear that NTFS owes some of its architectural design to Files-11 used by VMS. This is hardly surprising since Dave Cutler was the main lead for both VMS and Windows NT.1149_258 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	Recently the Apple Inc. has initiated the programme for installation of the Mac OS in ZFS of Sun Microsystem and also the primary support is already available in Mac OS X 10 and supports for Blue-Ray-disc.1149_259 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	Specified-utility file system1149_260 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	File Allocation Table (FAT) is a computer file system architecture now widely used on many computer systems and most memory cards&#44; such as those used with digital cameras. FAT file systems are commonly found on floppy disks&#44; flash memory cards&#44; digital cameras&#44; and many other portable devices because of their relative simplicity. For floppy disks&#44; the FAT has been standardized as ECMA-107[1] and ISO/IEC 9293.[2][3] Those standards include only FAT12 and FAT16 without long filename support; long filenames with FAT is partially patented1149_261 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	FAT (also sometimes incorrectly and inappropriately known as FAT64) is an incompatible replacement for FAT file systems that was introduced with Windows Embedded CE 6.0. It is intended to be used on flash drives&#44; where FAT is used today. Microsoft has offered a hotfix to add support for exFAT to Windows XP&#44;[24] while Windows Vista Service Pack 1 added exFAT support to Windows Vista.[25] exFAT introduces a free space bitmap allowing faster space allocation and faster deletes&#44; support for files up to 264 bytes (16777216 TB)&#44; larger cluster sizes (up to 32 MB in the first implementation)&#44; an extensible directory structure and name hashes for filenames for faster comparisons. It does not have short 8.3 filenames anymore. It does not appear to have security ACLs or file system journaling like NTFS&#44; though device manufacturers can choose to implement simplified support for transactions (backup file allocation table used for the write operations&#44; primary FAT for storing last known good allocation table).1149_263 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	The FAT file system does not contain mechanisms which prevent newly written files from becoming scattered across the partition.[20] Other file systems&#44; like HPFS&#44; use free space bitmaps that indicate used and available clusters&#44; which could then be quickly looked up in order to find free contiguous areas (improved in exFAT). Another solution is the linkage of all free clusters into one or more lists (as is done in Unix file systems). Instead&#44; the FAT has to be scanned as an array to find free clusters&#44; which can lead to performance penalties with large disks.  In fact&#44; computing free disk space on FAT is one of the most resource intensive operations&#44; as it requires reading the entire FAT linearly. A possible justification suggested by Microsoft&#39;s Raymond Chen for limiting the maximum size of FAT32 partitions created on Windows was the time required to perform a &quot;DIR&quot; operation&#44; which always displays the free disk space as the last line.[16] Displaying this line took longer and longer as the number of clusters increased.1149_264 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	In 2005&#44; Sun Microsystems released the bulk of its Solaris system code (based on UNIX System V Release 4) into an open source project called OpenSolaris. New Sun OS technologies&#44; notably the ZFS file system&#44; were first released as open source code via the OpenSolaris project. Soon afterwards&#44; OpenSolaris spawned several non-Sun distributions. In 2010&#44; after Oracle acquired Sun&#44; OpenSolaris was officially discontinued&#44; but the development of derivatives continued.the core tool kit of the Unix command set&#44; including cp&#44; ls&#44; grep&#44; find and many others. Subcategories include:  System utilities  administrative tools such as mkfs&#44; fsck&#44; and many others.  User utilities  environment management tools such as passwd&#44; kill&#44; and others.Shortly after UNIX System V Release 4 was produced&#44; AT&amp;T sold all its rights to UNIX to Novell. (Dennis Ritchie likened this to the Biblical story of Esau selling his birthright for the proverbial &quot;mess of pottage&quot;.[9]) Novell developed its own version&#44; UnixWare&#44; merging its NetWare with UNIX System V Release 4. Novell tried to use this to battle against Windows NT&#44; but their core markets suffered considerably.1149_265 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	Without doing the internal modernization&#44; these always   delete the temporary disadvantage of data copies.1149_268 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The Open Group&#44; an industry standards consortium&#44; owns the Unix trademark.

The Unix environment and the clientserver program model were essential elements in the development of the Internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers.1149_273 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Until about 2000&#44; users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the de facto standard&#44; but at that time&#44; other desktop environments such as GNOME and KDE SC were quickly becoming mature&#44; and became almost universal on the Linux platform&#44; which already had a larger user base than most commercial Unixes in total.SunSoft&#44; HP&#44; IBM and USL announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative. The primary environment was based on HP&#39;s VUE (Visual User Environment)&#44; itself derived from the Motif Window Manager (mwm). IBM contributed its Common User Access model and Workplace Shell.

Their last researchers to leave Multics&#44; Ken Thompson&#44; Dennis Ritchie&#44; M. D. McIlroy&#44; and J. F. Ossanna&#44;[3] decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale.

Many contributions to Unix first appeared on BSD releases&#44; notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel.

In the early 1990s a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium&#44; the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative&#44; which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification administered by The Open Group. Starting in 1998 the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group&#44; to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification.    In an effort towards compatibility&#44; in 1999 several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4&#39;s Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files.

Theologians have ascribed a variety of attributes to the many different conceptions of God. The most common among these include omniscience (infinite knowledge)&#44; omnipotence (unlimited power)&#44; omnipresence (present everywhere)&#44; omnibenevolence (perfect goodness)&#44; divine simplicity&#44; and eternal and necessary existence.    God has also been conceived as being incorporeal (immaterial)&#44; a personal being&#44; the source of all moral obligation&#44; and the &quot;greatest conceivable existent&quot;.[1] These attributes were all supported to varying degrees by the early Jewish&#44; Christian and Muslim theologian philosophers&#44; including Maimonides&#44;[2] Augustine of Hippo&#44;[2] and Al-Ghazali&#44;[3] respectively. Many notable medieval philosophers and modern philosophers developed arguments for the existence of God.[3] Many notable philosophers and intellectuals have&#44; in contrast&#44; developed arguments against the existence of God.1762_239 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	According to the Hindu custom&#44; the Hindu&#39;s life has been divided into four hermitages.1762_240 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	The first one is celibacy&#44; a phase which prepares the soul for development of spirituality&#44; bounded as a student&#44; as a Bachelor and living peacefully under the order and supervision of the teacher.1762_242 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	Conceptions of God vary widely. Theologians and philosophers have studied countless conceptions of God since the dawn of civilization. The Abrahamic conceptions of God include the monotheistic definition of God in Judaism&#44; the trinitarian view of Christians&#44; and the Islamic concept of God. The dharmic religions differ in their view of the divine: views of God in Hinduism vary by region&#44; sect&#44; and caste&#44; ranging from monotheistic to polytheistic to atheistic; the view of God in Buddhism is almost non-theist. In modern times&#44; some more abstract concepts have been developed&#44; such as process theology and open theism. Conceptions of God held by individual believers vary so widely that there is no clear consensus on the nature of God.[15]1762_243 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	Moreover&#44; proper treatment of parents&#44; children guests&#44; elders is the duty of Hindus.1762_245 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	There are many philosophical issues concerning the existence of God. Some definitions of God are sometimes nonspecific&#44; while other definitions can be self-contradictory. Arguments for the existence of God typically include metaphysical&#44; empirical&#44; inductive&#44; and subjective types&#44; while others revolve around perceived holes in evolutionary theory and order and complexity in the world. Arguments against the existence of God typically include empirical&#44; deductive&#44; and inductive types.

although the word love is often applied to close friendships.45247_12 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Because of the complex and abstract nature of love&#44; discourse on love is commonly reduced to a thought-terminating clich&#44;

Greek words for love)&#44; to the emotional closeness of familial love&#44; or to the platonic love that defines friendship&#44;[3] to the profound oneness or devotion of religious love. [4] This diversity of uses and meanings&#44; combined with the complexity of the feelings involved&#44; makes love unusually difficult to consistently define&#44; even compared to other emotional states.  Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and&#44; owing to its central psychological importance&#44; is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.45247_59 	A2M3NIA5MQX8G3 	The sexual love have full desire and body tension.45247_60 	A2M3NIA5MQX8G3 	If we scan mind of person who fallen in love his in position is like patient.In mind where desire started for food &#44; water that place love started.45247_65 	AN9IFNKPF7N1I 	Sun doesn&#39;t said to the earth &quot;you are mine creditor&quot;45247_66 	A2M3NIA5MQX8G3 	What happen with that love.45247_72 	AQYLTGQE4K8FV 	In Persian Culture everything is bonded with Love and everything is done for love&#44;love starts with friends and family members and also of the wife and husband and finally reaching the god with it is the final destiny.45247_73 	AQYLTGQE4K8FV 	Seven centuries ago Nady said like this:45247_74 	AQYLTGQE4K8FV 	All the Children of Adam are like Organs of one Body45247_75 	AQYLTGQE4K8FV 	They are created from the same descendant45247_78 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	If you are not sympathetic to other&#39;s problems45247_79 	AQYLTGQE4K8FV 	You will never have the Value of being a &quot;Human Being&quot;45247_80 	A2SUFIYSQCMJ5T 	The cultures of Chinese and other Singhs45247_82 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	In Chinese language and cultures&#44; there are many words and root words are used for love feeling.45247_83 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	it was also Emperor Kwing&#39;s first name.45247_84 	AN9IFNKPF7N1I 	I/0} is used as the verb (Ex45247_86 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	liyan is normally not used independently&#44; but &quot;being in love&quot; (tan liyan &#39;as part of the words that include ai-ai&#44; &quot;lover&quot; (li anron) or &quot;homosexual&quot; (tongjingliyan).45247_88 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	This is in the word ikvang.Kvingaran is used for the word lover.45247_89 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	In Confucianism&#44; Liyan indicates love with rightfulness&#44; generosity.45247_90 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	Liyan is followed by all mankind&#44; reflecting ethical life style.

Through its history&#44; China was the source of many major inventions.[8] It has also one of the world&#39;s oldest written language systems. The first evidence of human presence in the region was found at the Zhoukoudian cave. It is one of the earliest known specimens of Homo erectus&#44; now commonly known as the Peking Man&#44; estimated to have lived from 300&#44;000 to 780&#44;000 years ago45247_94 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In Taiwan&#44; the relationship between Mandarin and other languages in Taiwan&#44; particularly Taiwanese Hokkien&#44; has been more heated politically. During the martial law period under the Kuomintang (KMT) between 1949 and 1987&#44; the KMT government discouraged or&#44; in some cases&#44; forbade the use of Taiwanese Minnan and other vernaculars. This produced a political backlash in the 1990s. Under the administration of Chen Shui-Bian&#44; other Taiwanese languages were taught as an individual class&#44; with dedicated textbooks and course materials. The former President&#44; Chen Shui-Bian&#44; often spoke in Taiwanese Minnan during speeches&#44; while after late 1990s&#44; former President Lee Teng-hui&#44; also speaks Taiwanese Minnan openly.45247_95 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	The earliest evidence of a fully modern human in China comes from Liujiang County&#44; Guangxi&#44; where a cranium has been found and dated at approximately 67&#44;000 years old. Although much controversy persists over the dating of the Liujiang remains&#44;[23][24] a partial skeleton from Minatogawa in Okinawa&#44; Japan has been dated to 16&#44;600 to 18&#44;250 years old&#44; so modern humans probably reached China before that time45247_96 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	On Taiwan&#44; Guoyu (national language) continues to be the official term for Mandarin. The term Guoyu is relatively rarely used in Mainland China&#44; because declaring a Beijing-dialect-based standard to be the national language would be deemed unfair to other Chinese dialects and ethnic minorities.[citation needed] The term Putonghua (common speech)&#44; on the contrary&#44; implies nothing more than the notion of a lingua franca. However&#44; the term Guoyu does persist among many older Mainland Chinese&#44; and it is common in U.S. Chinese communities&#44; even among Mainlanders. Some in Taiwan&#44; especially proponents of Taiwan independence&#44; also object to the term Guoyu to refer to standardized Mandarin&#44; on the grounds that the &quot;nation&quot; referred to in the name of the language is China and that Taiwan is or should be independent. They prefer to refer to Mandarin with the terms &quot;Beijing dialect&quot; or Zhongwen (writing of China). Those hold other positions on the political spectrum in Taiwan display different views.45247_98 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In both mainland China and Taiwan&#44; the use of Mandarin as the medium of instruction in the educational system and in the media has contributed to the spread of Mandarin. As a result&#44; Mandarin is now spoken fluently by most people in mainland China and Taiwan.  In Hong Kong and Macau&#44; which are now special administrative regions of the People&#39;s Republic of China&#44; Standard Cantonese has been the primary language spoken by the majority of the population&#44; due to historical and linguistic reasons. After Hong Kong&#39;s handover from Britain and Macau&#39;s handover from Portugal&#44; Mandarin has become only slightly more understood (but still not widely spoken) and is used by the governments of the two territories to communicate with the Central People&#39;s Government of the PRC. Cantonese remains the official government language of Hong Kong and Macau when not communicating with mainland China.4531_100 	AE2CDTF7VQXCE 	Gandhi In Andhra tour in 19214531_101 	AE2CDTF7VQXCE 	&quot;Swadeshi&quot; - Prohibiting foreign articles&#44; churning cotton&#44; wearing &#39;Khaddar&#39;&#44; Rejecting foreign education and British government.4531_102 	AE2CDTF7VQXCE 	Because of this&#44; discipline increased in the revolution4531_103 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Women became very close to the revolution4531_105 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Self respect and self confidence in India&#39;s were at a  high4531_106 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	There was respect for the hard work and that was rewarding4531_107 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	&#39;Non cooperation movement&#39;- Protestors would refuse to buy British goods and uphold the values of Indian honor and integrity4531_108 	A3RS82XNENF2NT 	since government has no right to rule&#44;taxes should not be paid4531_110 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	This Movement received good response.4531_111 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	But in 1922 At Chauri Chaura of Uttar Pradesh&#44; rioting took place because of emotions and provocations coming into picture.4531_112 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	Gandhi suspended the movement immediately as he thought it was going out of control.4531_113 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	Removal of bad from society - According to mahathma gandhi independence means a chance to develop complete personality development of an individual.4531_115 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	We should observe that&#44; because  of thoughts introduced by Gandhi&#44;  today Indians are supported by  Respectable modern feelings&#44;  values.4531_116 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	In 1922 he spent two years in jail4531_117 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	in this period differences between extremists and moderates became strong internally in Congress.4531_118 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	Communical violence between Hinuds and Muslims also increased.4531_120 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	He was on hunger strike for three weeks in 1942.4531_121 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	But they were fruitful only to some extent.4531_122 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	He was involved in movements that took place against alcoholism&#44; untouchablity and illiteracy.4531_123 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	After the protest against the Simon Commission in 1927&#44; Gandhi took active participation again in the movement for independence.4531_125 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	But still there were no results.4531_126 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	On 31 December&#44; 1929&#44; India&#39;s independence flag was hoisted in Lahore.4531_127 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	He declared January 26 of 1930 as independence day.4531_128 	ADMENGADDLNDK 	It can be said that it was the last protest in the movement.4531_130 	A3B48GWF4518EC 	Gandhi in Dandi Satyagraham4531_132 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The salt march and quit india movements are main last stages in the movement of independance.4531_133 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The salt march was started in 1930 in protest against the  tax on salt.4531_135 	A3S0F1GABMBS9P 	From March 21 to April 6&#44;from Ahmedabad to Dandi&#44; 400KM4531_136 	A3B48GWF4518EC 	walk is the most important thing.4531_137 	A3S0F1GABMBS9P 	All along the way&#44; people appreciated&#44; Facilitated and prayed - Its an event that generations should know.4531_138 	A3S0F1GABMBS9P 	With the people who joined along the way its was a huge people mass.4531_140 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	In entire country a total of 60&#44;000 people were  taken into custody.4531_141 	A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 	Finally the government came down.4531_142 	AU7CIED3LX38J 	As per the Gandhi-Irwin pact in 1931&#44;the Movement was stopped.4531_145 	AU7CIED3LX38J 	But the Conference disappointed Gandhi and all freedom fighters.4531_146 	AU7CIED3LX38J 	Lord Willingdon&#44; who succeeded Lord Irwin&#44;tried to crush the freedom movement completely again.4531_147 	AU7CIED3LX38J 	In 1932&#44;to separate Muslims and Depressed Classes&#44; Separate Electorate was introduced.Opposing this&#44;Gandhi went on a fast unto death for 6 days and pressed for a solution by advocating Equality.

It grew to approximately 20&#44;000 articles and 18 language editions by the end of 2001. By late 2002&#44; it had reached 26 language editions&#44; 46 by the end of 2003&#44; and 161 by the final days of 2004.[31] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former&#39;s servers were taken down permanently in 2003&#44; and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. English Wikipedia passed the 2 million-article mark on September 9&#44; 2007&#44; making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled&#44; eclipsing even the Yongle Encyclopedia (1407)&#44; which had held the record for exactly 600 years.72463_21 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	Later that year&#44; Wales announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements&#44; and its website was changed to wikipedia.org.72463_22 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	Various projects have been divided from Wikipedia due to editorial reasons.72463_23 	A1E6RS45GUAFC3 	Wikinfo does not require a neutral point of view and this allows core research.

When Time magazine recognized You as its Person of the Year for 2006&#44; acknowledging the accelerating success of online collaboration and interaction by millions of users around the world&#44; it cited Wikipedia as one of several examples of Web 2.0 services&#44; along with YouTube&#44; MySpace&#44; and Facebook.[18] Some noted the importance of Wikipedia not only as an encyclopedic reference but also as a frequently updated news resource because of how quickly articles about recent events appear.[19][20] Students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles&#44; as an exercise in clearly and succinctly explaining difficult concepts to an uninitiated audience.72463_35 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Only registered users can submit new articles(only in the English edition). With the result of this&#44; there were no legal promises done by Wikipedia72463_37 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	It was made clear that this policy is not up for debate&#44; and the policy has sometimes proved controversial. For instance&#44; in 2008&#44; Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of Muhammad&#39;s depictions in its English edition&#44; citing this policy. The presence of politically sensitive materials in Wikipedia had also led the People&#39;s Republic of China to block access to parts of the site.[98] (See also: IWF block of Wikipedia)72463_39 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	For legal reasons&#44; content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular copyright law) of Florida&#44; where Wikipedia servers are hosted.

While they still show broad-brush similarities&#44; they differ in many details.72463_40 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The &quot;History&quot; page attached to each article records every single past revision of the article&#44; though a revision with libelous content&#44; criminal threats or copyright infringements may be removed afterwards.[50][51] This feature makes it easy to compare old and new versions&#44; undo changes that an editor considers undesirable&#44; or restore lost content. The &quot;Discussion&quot; pages associated with each article are used to coordinate work among multiple editors.[52] Regular contributors often maintain a &quot;watchlist&quot; of articles of interest to them&#44; so that they can easily keep tabs on all recent changes to those articles. Computer programs called Internet bots have been used widely to remove vandalism as soon as it was made&#44;[16] to correct common misspellings and stylistic issues&#44; or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.72463_41 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	A topic should also meet Wikipedia&#39;s standards of &quot;notability&quot;72463_43 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Among Wikipedia editors&#44; this is often phrased as &quot;verifiability&#44; not truth&quot; to express the idea that the readers&#44; not the encyclopedia&#44; are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.72463_44 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Finally&#44; Wikipedia must not take a side.72463_45 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	All opinions and viewpoints&#44; if attributable to external sources&#44; must enjoy appropriate share of coverage within an article.72463_46 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Wikipedia has many methods of settling disputes. A &quot;bold&#44; revert&#44; discuss&quot; cycle sometimes occurs&#44; in which a user makes an edit&#44; another user reverts it&#44; and the matter is discussed on the appropriate talk page. In order to gain a broader community consensus&#44; issues can be raised at the Village Pump&#44; or a Request for Comment can be made soliciting other users&#39; input.72463_48 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Editors keep track of changes to articles by checking the difference between two revisions of a page&#44; displayed here in red.72463_49 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	In departure from the style of traditional encyclopedias&#44; Wikipedia employs an open&#44; &quot;wiki&quot; editing model.

No article is owned by its creator or any other editor&#44; or is vetted by any recognized authority; rather&#44; the articles are collectively owned by a community of editors and are agreed on by consensus.72463_50 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	This feature makes it easy to compare old and new versions&#44; undo changes that an editor considers undesirable&#44; or restore lost content.

For example&#44; a reader of an article cannot be certain that it has not been compromised by the insertion of false information or the removal of essential information.72463_54 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Former Encyclopdia Britannica editor-in-chief Robert McHenry once described this by saying72463_55 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	Committees rarely write well&#44; and writings entered in Wikipedia by different people writing sentences or paragraphs get mixed and often have a choppy quality&quot;72463_56 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	With all these&#44; a question arises about the quality of information provided by Wikipedia.72463_59 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Wikipedia has been accused of exhibiting systemic bias and inconsistency  additionally&#44; critics argue that Wikipedia&#39;s open nature and a lack of proper sources for much of the information makes it unreliable.

Confidence  on them depends on others who work in the same&quot;  field and people &#39;s interests and praiser &#39;s interests.72463_74 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia&#44; a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Nupedia was founded on March 9&#44; 2000&#44; under the ownership of Bomis&#44; Inc&#44; a web portal company. Its main figures were Jimmy Wales&#44; Bomis CEO&#44; and Larry Sanger&#44; editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia Open Content License&#44; switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia&#39;s founding at the urging of Richard Stallman.72463_75 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia&#44; Slashdot postings&#44; and web search engine indexing. It grew to approximately 20&#44;000 articles and 18 language editions by the end of 2001.

He complains that the web-based sources are discouraging students from learning from the more rare texts which are either found only on paper or are on subscription-only web sites. In the same article Jenny Fry (a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute) commented on academics who cite Wikipedia&#44; saying that: &quot;You cannot say children are intellectually lazy because they are using the Internet when academics are using search engines in their research. The difference is that they have more experience of being critical about what is retrieved and whether it is authoritative. Children need to be told how to use the Internet in a critical and appropriate way.72463_77 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	In February 2007&#44; an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that some of the professors at Harvard University include Wikipedia in their syllabi&#44; but that there is a split in their perception of using Wikipedia.[115] In June 2007&#44; former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia&#44; along with Google&#44;[116] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are &quot;the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything.&quot; He also said that &quot;a generation of intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the Internet&quot; was being produced at universities.

A team led by Ed H. Chi at the Palo Alto Research Center speculated that this is due to the increasing exclusiveness of the project.[37] New or occasional editors have significantly higher rates of their edits reverted (removed) than an elite group of regular editors&#44; colloquially known as the &quot;cabal.&quot; This could make it more difficult for the project to recruit and retain new contributors&#44; over the long term resulting in stagnation in article creation. Others simply point out that the low-hanging fruit&#44; the obvious articles like China&#44; already exist&#44; and believe that the growth is flattening naturally.72463_80 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	60% of registered users never make another edit after their first 24 hours. Possible explanations are that such users only register for a single purpose&#44; or are scared away by their experiences.[143] Goldman writes that editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals&#44; such as signing talk pages&#44; implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders&#44; increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders will target their contributions as a threat. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs; the contributor is expected to build a user page&#44; learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes&#44; submit to an arcane dispute resolution process&#44; and learn a &quot;baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references.&quot; Non-logged-in users are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia&#44;[144] as &quot;participants are accredited by members of the wiki community&#44; who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product&#44; on the basis of their ongoing participation&#44;&quot;[145] but the contribution histories of IP addresses cannot necessarily with any certainty be credited to&#44; or blamed upon&#44; a particular user.72463_81 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	For legal reasons&#44; content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular copyright law) of Florida&#44; where Wikipedia servers are hosted.

Bush&#44; David Cameron or homework). In place of an editing prohibition for new or unregistered users&#44; there would be a &quot;new system&#44; called &#39;pending changes&#39;&quot; which&#44; Jimmy Wales told the British Broadcasting Corporation&#44; would enable the English Wikipedia &quot;to open up articles for general editing that have been protected or semi-protected for years.&quot; The &quot;pending changes&quot; system was introduced on June 15&#44; shortly after 11pm GMT. Edits to specified articles are now &quot;subject to review from an established Wikipedia editor before publication.&quot; Wales opted against the German Wikipedia model of requiring editor review before edits to any article&#44; describing it as &quot;neither necessary nor desirable.&quot; He added that the administrators of the German Wikipedia were &quot;going to be closely watching the English system&#44; and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll at least consider switching if the results are good.72463_96 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Wales performed a study finding that over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users (at the time: 524 people). This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz&#44; who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[128] A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that &quot;anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site.&quot;[129] Although some contributors are authorities in their field&#44; Wikipedia requires that even their contributions be supported by published and verifiable sources. The project&#39;s preference for consensus over credentials has been labeled &quot;anti-elitism.&quot;72463_97 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Although some contributors are authorities in their field&#44; Wikipedia requires that even their contributions be supported by published and verifiable sources.72463_99 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Though the English Wikipedia reached 3 million articles in August 2009&#44; the growth of the edition&#44; in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors&#44; appeared to have flattened off around early 2007.[36] In July 2007&#44; about 2&#44;200 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia; as of August 2009&#44; that average is 1&#44;300. A team led by Ed H. Chi at the Palo Alto Research Center speculated that this is due to the increasing exclusiveness of the project.[37] New or occasional editors have significantly higher rates of their edits reverted (removed) than an elite group of regular editors&#44; colloquially known as the &quot;cabal.&quot; This could make it more difficult for the project to recruit and retain new contributors&#44; over the long term resulting in stagnation in article creation. Others simply point out that the low-hanging fruit&#44; the obvious articles like China&#44; already exist&#44; and believe that the growth is flattening naturally.72770_10 	A3QL2TAO2U5TM9 	They all formed as an organization on January 01&#44;

Buddha&#39;s purpose of the birth was to delude asuras. The Sri Vaishnavas do not believe that Buddha was Vishnu&#39;s incarnation&#44; but Madhvas believe that Buddha was indeed Vishnu&#39;s incarnation. In the Brahmanda purana it is said (source wiki) &quot;In order to delude the demons&#44; he (Lord Buddha) was present in the form of a child on the way while the foolish Jina (a demon)&#44; imagined him to be his son. Later on&#44; Lord Sri Hari (as avatara-buddha) expertly deluded Jina and other demons by his strong words of non-violence.&quot;  The twenty-second incarnation is yet to come. And Vishnu will come. Vishnu will be born as Kalki&#44; so as to destroy evil in the world and restore righteousness&quot;.  There have been several other incarnations of Vishnu.

This Purana deals with astronomy&#44; medicine&#44; grammar&#44; and gemstone structure and qualities. In addition&#44; the Garuda Purana is considered the authoritative Vedic reference volume describing the Nine Pearls&#44; which includes not only the well known Oyster Pearl&#44; but also the Conch Pearl&#44; Cobra Pearl&#44; Boar Pearl&#44; Elephant Pearl&#44; Bamboo Pearl&#44; Whale Pearl&#44; Fish Pearl&#44; and Cloud Pearl.81232_13 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The Garuda Purana is a Vaishnava Purana. The others in this group are Vishnu Purana&#44; Narada Purana&#44; Bhagavata Purana&#44; Padma Purana and Varaha Purana.  The Garuda Purana has nineteen thousand shlokas(lines). It is a medium-sized Purana. The Skanda Purana&#44; for example&#44; has eighty-one thousand shlokas. And the Markandeya Purana only nine thousand. The thousand shlokas of the Garuda Purana are divided into two parts&#44; a purva khanda (first part) and an uttara khanda (subsequent part). Each khanda has several chapters (adhyaya). The purva khanda is much longer&#44; it has two hundred and thirty-four chapters. The Uttara khanda has only forty-five.  The latter half of this Purana deals with life after death. The followers of the eternal Vedas&#44; addressed as &quot;Hindus&quot; of India generally read this Purana while cremating the physically dead bodies of departed atmaas/souls. This has given great importance to the origin of Garuda. There are nineteen thousand verses describing the ways to the Lord.81232_15 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Vedavyasa taught the Puranas to one of his disciples named Romaharshana or Lomaharshana. He was thus named because the hair (roma) on his body was thrilled (harshana) when he heard the Puranas from his teacher. It was Romaharshana who related the stories of the Puranas to everyone else. The Bhagavata Purana says the Romaharshana had a son named Suta and it was this son who related the story of that particular Purana to the other sages . On the other hand&#44; Romaharshana himself belonged to the suta class&#44; so that he too could be addressed as Suta. From reading the Garuda Purana&#44; one does get the impression that it is Romaharshana himself who is relating the story&#44; and not his son.  To come back to the point&#44; Romaharshana came to a forest known as Naimisharanya. He sat there and contemplated the mysteries of the Lord Vishnu.  Several other rishis (sages) led by Shounaka also came to the forest. They told Romaharshana&#44; &quot;Sage&#44; you know everything. Who is the god of all gods? Who is to be worshipped? What does one meditate on? Who destroys evil? How did the world come to be created? What is dharma (righteousness)? Tell us all these things and more&quot;.81232_16 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Garuda Purana is in the form of instructions by Vishnu to his carrier&#44; Garuda (The King of Birds - a vahana of Bhagawaan* Vishnu).

Vamana is a disguise of a short Brahman&#44; carrying a wooden umbrella requested three steps of land for him to live in.

Theologians have ascribed a variety of attributes to the many different conceptions of God. The most common among these include omniscience (infinite knowledge)&#44; omnipotence (unlimited power)&#44; omnipresence (present everywhere)&#44; omnibenevolence (perfect goodness)&#44; divine simplicity&#44; and eternal and necessary existence.  God has also been conceived as being incorporeal (immaterial)&#44; a personal being&#44; the source of all moral obligation&#44; and the &quot;greatest conceivable existent&quot;.[1] These attributes were all supported to varying degrees by the early Jewish&#44; Christian and Muslim theologian philosophers&#44; including Maimonides&#44;[2] Augustine of Hippo&#44;[2] and Al-Ghazali&#44;[3] respectively. Many notable medieval philosophers and modern philosophers developed arguments for the existence of God.[3] Many notable philosophers and intellectuals have&#44; in contrast&#44; developed arguments against the existence of God.84960_11 	A31PUL91ZMCDBU 	because of the rule of english and muslims&#44; the historic vijayanagaram was defeated84960_12 	A31PUL91ZMCDBU 	nature calamities will occur&#44; surprises&#44; babas will appear&#44; people will be deceived and social activities will be taken place84960_13 	A2SUFIYSQCMJ5T 	He said again and again that in the end of kaliyuga i will return back.84960_14 	A31PUL91ZMCDBU 	some directions were given when he will be coming84960_16 	A31PUL91ZMCDBU 	he was burried alive in 17584960_17 	A2SUFIYSQCMJ5T 	He discussed the burial incident with his son and explained his age.84960_18 	AH89E958S7NST 	He offered his Kamandalam&#44; Dandam&#44; Padukalu and Ring to his disciple to satisfy his great disciple cry after his live burial.84960_21 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	What ever happened till now84960_22 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	The lights will be lit by water84960_23 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	The carts will move with out the cows84960_26 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	A widow will rule the government for 16 years84960_28 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Screen actors will become politicians84960_29 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	People will be deceived by the colors of the actors.84960_31 	ATL26PCKZXO2H 	Kings and kingdoms shall be destroyed84960_32 	ATL26PCKZXO2H 	democratic rule will arrive84960_33 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	Many people would die due to aeroplane crash.84960_36 	ATL26PCKZXO2H 	Brahmins and  there  living places shall be destroyed84960_37 	ATL26PCKZXO2H 	Hindus and Muslims will kill each other and die in Hyderabad city.84960_39 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	Temples will be destroyed by sinners.84960_41 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	Wonderful machines will come.84960_42 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	but cannot solve life and birth.84960_43 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	They will try to change the creation.84960_44 	AI5E50BGAUZH2 	Evil forces raise and there will be riots in the country.84960_46 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	A short but tough fellow will rule the country.84960_48 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	Cunning saints will increase in number.84960_49 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	All the people will be deceived by them.84960_51 	A1WCVMMFKMAB0C 	Mr. Brahmmam &#39;s full name is Potuluri Brahmmendra Swami84960_52 	A8VHPYIT5L7EA 	He was born at Banaganapalli in Kurnool district.84960_53 	A8VHPYIT5L7EA 	Though there is no clarity on his life time&#44; it is estimated to be in between 1500-1610A.D.84960_54 	AMKGJUEEY6ZCH 	His father&#39;s name is Veera Bojya rayulu and mother name is Papamamba.84960_56 	AMKGJUEEY6ZCH 	He used to think more time on spirit individualities and mothers tongue.84960_57 	A8VHPYIT5L7EA 	After the death of his father&#44; at the age of eight he decided to acquire self-enlightenment and asked his mother to permit him to travel across the country.84960_58 	A8VHPYIT5L7EA 	Because of affection and love towards her son&#44; as she refused to permit him&#44; he conciliated his mother with his enlighted preachings.84960_59 	AMKGJUEEY6ZCH 	In that time he used to teach many lessons about death and life secrets about human beings and made his mother to be agree and satisfy&#44; from that he granted permission from his mother for going out of state.84960_61 	AQYLTGQE4K8FV 	Brahmam alike the great sage Adishankara likes to travel to gain knowledge and then enlighten the people around him with his knowledge he gained.84960_62 	A8F58O3WZN974 	He started his first knowledge preachings with his mother.84960_63 	A8F58O3WZN974 	He preached that&#44;&quot;our physique is an embodiment of five things moulded with sky&#44; air&#44; fire&#44; earth and water.

Earth has often been personified as a deity&#44; in particular a goddess. In many cultures the mother goddess is also portrayed as a fertility deity. Creation myths in many religions recall a story involving the creation of the Earth by a supernatural deity or deities. A variety of religious groups&#44; often associated with fundamentalist branches of Protestantism  or Islam&#44;  assert that their interpretations of these creation myths in sacred texts are literal truth and should be considered alongside or replace conventional scientific accounts of the formation of the Earth and the origin and development of life.34672_140 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Such assertions are opposed by the scientific community and by other religious groups34672_141 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	A prominent example is the creation-evolution controversy.In the past there were varying levels of belief in a flat Earth&#44;

Aska means a feeling called to love&#44; it is still in use in Turk. In Turk&#44; this word is used to indicate the emotions of great origin or sexual love. If a Turk says that he or she is in love (aska) then it is not like the love that he or she shows towards the parents; it is limited to only one person&#44; and it indicates lustful love.45247_124 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	The Latin language has several different verbs corresponding to the English word &quot;love.&quot;45247_125 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Amre is the basic word for to love&#44; as it still is in Italian today.

This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun diligentia&#44; however&#44; has the meaning of &quot;diligence&quot; or &quot;carefulness&#44;&quot; and has little semantic overlap with the verb.45247_131 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Observare  is a synonym for diligere; despite the cognate with English&#44; this verb and its corresponding noun&#44; observantia&#44; often denote &quot;esteem&quot; or &quot;affection.&quot;45247_136 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Cor-ten steel sculpture by Robert Indiana in 197745247_138 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	Thou shalt not take vengeance&#44; nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people&#44; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the LORD.

And Christians those who believe that they are loved by the god should choose this way.45247_186 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The practice of muraqaba can be likened to the practices of meditation attested in many faith communities. The word muraqaba is derived from the same root (r-q-b) occurring as one of the 99 Names of God in the Qur&#39;an&#44; al-Raqb&#44; meaning &quot;the Vigilant&quot; and attested in verse 4: 1 of the Qur&#39;an. Through muraqaba&#44; a person watches over or takes care of the spiritual heart&#44; acquires knowledge about it&#44; and becomes attuned to the Divine Presence&#44; which is ever vigilant.45247_187 	A2M3NIA5MQX8G3 	Isque&#44; or Sufisim is based on the God&#39;s love.45247_188 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Classical Sufi scholars have defined Sufism as &quot;a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God.&quot;[4] Alternatively&#44; in the words of the Darqawi Sufi teacher Ahmad ibn Ajiba&#44; &quot;a science through which one can know how to travel into the presence of the Divine&#44; purify ones inner self from filth&#44; and beautify it with a variety of praiseworthy traits.&quot;The Sufi is the one who wears wool on top of purity.&quot;[11] The wool cloaks were sometimes a designation of their initiation into the Sufi order. Sufism is known as &quot;Islamic Mysticism&#44;&quot; in which Muslims seek to find divine love and knowledge through direct personal experience of God.45247_189 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation&#44; such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct reference or description&#44; with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance&#44; much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication&#44; which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also&#44; some groups emerged that considered themselves above the Sharia and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.  For these and other reasons&#44; the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars&#44; such as Al-Ghazali&#44; helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it.45247_192 	A2M3NIA5MQX8G3 	In Buddism&#44; K&amp;#257; Maa is the happiness  of the love.45247_193 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	It is unselfish want.It stands like a barrier in divine path.45247_194 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	karu&amp;#7751:it means the encouragement that reduces the worries of others and kindness.It technically wil be a path and helps for divine growth.45247_196 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	This love is unconditional and require maximum self respect45247_197 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	This is  a common relationship without having selflessness and is  different from the love. Instead  in Buddhism&#44; the love desires the safety of the others and try to  be there for namesake and has selfless interest.45247_198 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Demographically&#44; Hinduism is the world&#39;s third or fourth largest religion&#44; after Christianity&#44; Islam&#44; and possibly Buddhism&#44; with more than a billion adherents&#44; of whom approximately 1 billion&#44; live in the Republic of India.[10][11] Other significant populations are found in Nepal (23 million)&#44; Bangladesh (14 million) and the Indonesian island of Bali (3.3 million).45247_199 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	It was only towards the end of the 18th century that the European merchants and colonists referred collectively to the followers of Indian religions as Hindus. Eventually&#44; it came to define a precisely religious identity that includes any person of Indian origin who neither practiced Abrahamic religions nor non-Vedic Indian religions&#44; such as Jainism&#44; Sikhism or Buddhism&#44; thereby encompassing a wide range of religious beliefs and practices related to Santana Dharma45247_201 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	The exact conceptualization of moksha differs among the various Hindu schools of thought. For example&#44; Advaita Vedanta holds that after attaining moksha an atman no longer identifies itself with an individual but as identical with Brahman in all respects. The followers of Dvaita (dualistic) schools identify themselves as part of Brahman&#44; and after attaining moksha expect to spend eternity in a loka (heaven)&#44;[91] in the company of their chosen form of Ishvara. Thus&#44; it is said that the followers of dvaita wish to &quot;taste sugar&quot;&#44; while the followers of Advaita wish to &quot;become sugar&quot;45247_202 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	He is the owner of his wife rathi&#44;and vasanth &#44;with his friend   vasanth&#44;who id the owner of time.The idols of rathi and kama  pictures can be seen on the doors of chennakeasav temple in beluros in karnataka.45247_203 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	In contrast to want&#44;love or love related are the highest   papers.45247_204 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	Kindness is the door of encouragement and kind.It helps to   relieve the other&#39;s worries and moves forward.45247_206 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	The one who practices devotion is called a Devotee45247_207 	A3V7G0CFREWGTP 	The Hindu writers&#44;religious priests and philosophers explained that devotion styles are of nine kinds.

several West German Lnder simplified their school system to two or three tiers.53283_446 	A3RS82XNENF2NT 	Motives were: The example of Eastern Germany where in the 1990s&#44; following reunification&#44; a two-tier school system was established; mediocre scores in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)&#44; first published in 2001&#44; prompted a nation-wide debate about the school system&#44; and in particular about the social selectivity of early stratification; having low standards of achievement&#44; inner-city Hauptschulen were increasingly considered dysfunctional by some people; outside the metropoles&#44; the population is shrinking&#44; so that according to some people it becomes increasingly unpractical to maintain a three- or four-tier school system.53283_449 	A3RS82XNENF2NT 	To enter a university in Germany&#44;

it is very difficult for Europe which is in a very big boundary and with a very highly developed culture&#44; to recognise separately the clear German culture.53283_461 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Another result of this situation is that though some historic persons like Volfagyang Amedius Mozart&#44;

This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing (monarchist&#44; vlkisch&#44; and Nazi) Dolchstolegende&#44; which promoted the view that Germany had lost World War I because of the efforts and influence of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The top brass of the Weimar government was accused of betraying the German Nation by signing the Versailles Treaty&#44; while the radical left-wing communists&#44; such as the Spartacist League&#44; had wanted a revolution to abolish &quot;capitalist rule&quot; in favour of a Rterepublik&#44; and were also targeted.53283_486 	A20TYKNP46IORG 	Of all the books publish across the world&#44; 18% have been exported from German company53283_487 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	(2008&#44; Frankfurt book fair)53283_488 	A3J1PP96QX14U0 	There are 34 million households with TV.

The locals say that the idol was initially much smaller than its present size. They say that certain experimentation was carried out on this idol and it was said that the type of rock out of which the idol is carved has a growing or enlarging nature associated with it. As per Archaeological Survey of India the rock grows at the rate of 1 inch per 20 years (10 mm per 8 years).  It is said that people used to do Pradakshinas (rounds) around it in the past. The temple staff has already removed one pillar as the size of the Nandi has increased.

It was built according to Vaishnavaite traditions.  One story of the site&#39;s origin is as follows: The sage Agastya wanted to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site. However&#44; the statue that was made could not be installed as the toenail of the deity got broken. The sage was upset over this and performed a penance for Lord Shiva. When Lord Shiva appeared&#44; he said the place suits Shiva better as it resembles Kailash. Agastya then requested Lord Shiva to give the devotees a Parvathi Goddess as Lord Uma Maheswara in a single stone&#44; which Lord Shiva obliged.  A second story is as follows: Chitteppa&#44; a devotee of Lord Shiva&#44; was worshiping Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva appeared to him as a tiger. Chitteppa understood that it was Lord Shiva in tiger form&#44; and shouted Neganti Shivanu ne khanti (meaning: I saw Shiva I saw)&#44; and danced with joy. There is a cave called Chitteppa nearby.    The story according to the priests is that when the sage Agastya compleated his uttara desha yatra and started dakshina desha yatra he found the beautiful and pleasent place called yaganti( Nekanti-i have seen)and thought to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site . while roaming around caves one of the caves was found to have a very old statue of Lord Vishnu . After all the yagna&#44; homa and poojas he found that the statue really contains a small defect as broken nail on the foot thumb finger. To seek an explanation he prayed to Shiva and Shiva explained that at this place which contains natural springs and nature only I can be worshipped. Then the sage Agastya asked a boom to Shiva to reside in this place for eternity with Mother Parvathi. So this place is called as Umamahesware (ume: parvathi&#44; maheswara: shiva) temple. The shrine contains the statue of Shiva and Parvathi on a single stone.84960_179 	A15YKQU4TT7169 	The story according to the priests is that when the sage Agastya compleated his uttara desha yatra and started dakshina desha yatra he found the beautiful and pleasent place called yaganti( Nekanti-i have seen)and thought to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site . while roaming around caves one of the caves was found to have a very old statue of Lord Vishnu .
