subtraction&#44; multiplication and division&#44; these four basic methods appeared when humans learnt to identify numbers differently from the real matter and from that the journey of arithmetic.1193_22 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	For the next development in mathematics&#44; we have to go to 2000 AD when Babilonian and Egiptian civilization flourished.1193_23 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	Ancient Babylonians of Mesopotamia and ancient Egyptians of Nile river valley&#44; have left the most ancient evidence of cultivated mathematics.1193_24 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	Arithmetic was prevalent in their mathematics.1193_25 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	Measurement and calculations were given more primacy in geometry&#44;

eash hour into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds.1193_41 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Their number system was based on 60.1193_42 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The number 1 was written with a notch like a nail and it was written repeatedly to point out the number 9.1193_43 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Numbers from 11 to 59 were denoted by the symbols used for 1 and 10.1193_44 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	For the numbers greater than 60 the Babylonians used a positional symbol.1193_65 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	They used hieroglyphics symbols to represent the power or multiple of ten.1193_66 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	They wrote 5 by using the sign for 1 five times&#44; 60 by using the sign for 6 ten times&#44; and indicated 300 by writing the sign of 100 three times.1193_67 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Together these signs represented 365.1193_70 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The base of quantitative research are numbers.1193_71 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In arithmetic&#44;

2001 Jimmy Wales proposed to create the Nupedia mailing list as a Wiki as an associated project of Nupedia.1208_21 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Wikipedia was officially launched as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com on January 15&#44; 2001 and Sanger announced it on the Nupedia mailing list.1208_23 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Apart from that&#44; some more rules and policies were prepared to run the encyclopedia correctly and according to that Wikipedia started operating independently being separated from Nupedia.1208_26 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The growth of the number of articles in the English Wikipedia is shown through the graph&#44; this is shown from 10th January&#44; 2001 till 9th September&#44; 2007 (the day when the articles of the Wikipedia surpassed the number of 2 million).1208_27 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Initially&#44; the articles of the Wikipedia were created through Nupedia&#44; Slashdot posting and search engine indexing.1208_28 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Within 2001 there were almost 20&#44;000 essays in 18 languages in Wikipedia.1208_29 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	By the end of 2003 works started in 26 languages and within the year 2003 Wikipedia operated in 46 languages.1208_30 	AZVAVU4OYMG2A 	Before the end of 2004 Wikipedia starts project for 161 languages.1208_31 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	On 2003 before the problem Newpedia and Wikipedia were seperate and after that all were registered with Wikipedia.1208_32 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	On 9th September&#44;

this was manifested through a song created by the other disciples of the group in the name of him after he had left the group: &quot;We are now without the master/we only think of this day and night&#44; with melancholy hearts/ his name is Nazrul Islam&#44; what shall we give to prove his qualities&quot;.1529_65 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	In his student life his first schooling was in Raj School of Rani Ganj.1529_66 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	After this he took admission in Mathrun High School&#44; which later became to be known as Nabinchandra Institution.1529_67 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	During that period Kumudranjan Mallik&#44; a well known poet of that time&#44;was the headmaster of Mathrun school.1529_68 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Nazrul was highly inspired by him.1529_69 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	While reminiscing&#44; Kumudranjan wrote about Najrul&#44; &quot;However&#44; he was not able to study here for long due to finanacial problems&quot;.1529_70 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	He was back to work after finishing sixth grade.1529_71 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	At first he joined Basudev&#39;s &#39;kavidal&#39; (group of extempore poets).1529_72 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	After that he joined as a table servant to a Christian railway guard and finally as a tea and bread maker in a shop at Assansole (a place in the state of West Bengal of India).1529_74 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	While working at the tea-stall&#44; he met police inspector Rafizullah.1529_75 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Rafizullah came to know of his talents by reading the poems and verses that Nazrul used to create while he had been alone in the shop.1529_76 	AAF85ZPWB65DY 	He enrolled Nazrul in the seventh class of the Darirampur School in Trishal&#44; Mymensingh District&#44; in the year 1914.1529_77 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	In 1915&#44; he went back to Searsole Raj School in Ranigunj and started studying in class VIII there.1529_78 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He studied here till 1917.1529_79 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Towards the end of 1917&#44; he joined army in stead of appearing for the Secondary Pre-test examination.1529_80 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	While studying in this school&#44; Nazrul was influenced by four teachers.1529_81 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	They are Satish Chandra Kanjilal of classical music&#44;

he carried on practicing songs with different types of native and foreign musical instruments with his fellow-soldiers and practicing of poems and proses was also carried on by him at the same time.1529_94 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Among the creations that Nazrul had finished during his stay at the Karachi Army base were &quot;Bounduler Atmakahini&quot; (The Autobiography of a Vagabond) (this was his first prose)&#44; &quot;Mukti&quot; (The Freedom) (his first published poem); Stories: &quot;Hena&quot; (type of plant used to color)&#44; &quot;Byathar Dan&quot;

Saratchandra Chattopadhay and Farasee writer Hafiz.1529_98 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	From this information it can be told that Najrul&#39;s starting of literary work was in the army quarter of Karachi.1529_99 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	When he was a solder he took part in the 1st world war.1570_10 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In consequence of the preaching and winning over the wars by Muhammad (Shah) and his successors the religion of Islam spreads rapidly throughout the world.1570_11 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Presently Muslims live throughout the world&#44; especially in the middle east&#44; North Africa&#44; south Asia&#44; central Asia and south east Asia.1570_12 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	In Arab though this religion is not that dominant as before but most are muslims.1570_13 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Are non-Arabian and the Muslims of Arab forms only one-fifth part of the Muslim population of the world.1570_14 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Islam is the second largest religion in many of the European countries including the United Kingdom.1570_15 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Religious belief1570_16 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Muslims believe that God sent his literal words for human beings to Muhammad through the archangel Gabriel.1570_17 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	On the basis of his self-proclamation by Muhammad and by the &quot;Khatme Nabyut&quot; mentioned in the Holy Quran&#44; the Muslims believe him to be the last message bearer (Nabi) of Allah.1570_19 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Muslims believe that all the men sent by the God starting from Adam have preached the maxims of Islam.1570_20 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	From Islamic viewpoint both the Yudhis and the Christians are traditions of Abraham&#39;s teachings.1570_21 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Quran has called the believers of these two religions as &quot;Ahle Kitab&quot; and separated them from the believers of multi-gods1570_22 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Various events and matters of the books of these two religions are found in the Quran though differences are noticed in some cases.1570_23 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	According to Islamic belief the followers of these two religions had derogated the words of God in its meaning and in various other ways: Taurat (Torah) by the Yahudis and Injil (New Bible) by the Christians.1570_25 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Muslims call their god &#39;Allah&#39;.1570_26 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The basic faith of the Islam is the oneness or &#39;touhid&#39; of Allah.1570_27 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Islam believes in only one God and in no way does Islam believe in partial or multi Gods.1570_28 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Allah&#39;s oneness is among the five main pillars of the Islam&#44; which is called Shahdah.1570_29 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	By reading this one accepts that (1) There is no god except &#39;Allah&#39; to worship and (2) Muhammad(S) is his messenger.1570_31 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	[Unable to translate Urdu]1570_32 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	Originally the word &quot;Allah&quot; came from the word &quot;Illah&quot;.1570_33 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Though the Christians demand that the Christianity is a monotheism but the Muslims deny the faith of the Christians of the trinity or the union of father&#44; son and holy soul in one god as the polytheism.1570_34 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	According to Islam&#44; God has no particular size&#44; and therefore describing and giving it a particular shape is impossible and can be compared with worshipping of imaginary construction of God.1570_35 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This type of ideas of formlessness is also found in the Judaism and in some Christian faiths too.1570_36 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Muslims describe their God through several qualitative names and qualities.1570_40 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Handwritten by Hattat Aziz Afendi-- the First Surah of Quran.1570_41 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	&quot;Koran&quot; is the main religious book of Muslims.1570_42 	A3BNFNWQX37CQV 	Muslims believe that the Qur&#39;an is the literal Word of God1570_55 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	He had founded the religions of Islam and the religious community of Muslims or Ummah.1570_56 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He is respected and honored as the greatest messenger of God (Nabi).1570_57 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Muslims don&#39;t consider him to be a founder of a new religion.1570_58 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	On the contrary&#44; Muhammad (Shah) to them is the last prophet of the tradition of prophets who maintains the continuity of monotheism preached by Adam (Ah)&#44; Ibrahim (Ah) and other prophets that has been changed and vitiated occasionally and presents the religion of Islam on be half of the God as the last transmitted religion.1570_59 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	According to Islam religion&#44; for 23 years until his death from the age of 40&#44; he received the message of God through Feresta Jibreel.1570_60 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	This message put together is called the Quran which was memorized by him and recorded by his companions (Sahabah).1570_61 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Because he himself was an illiterate person.1570_62 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	All Muslims believe that Muhammad (Shah) has preached these sermons correctly:1570_63 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	Although the Sunni Muslims do not believe that Muhammad(SM)and all other Prophets never made any mistake&#44;the Shia Muslims cherish that belief about all Prophets and their Imams.1570_64 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The following Ayat is discussed as the examples of making mistake by Muhammad or doing works that displease Allah:1570_65 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In this way the acts of Muhammad was corrected in some more parts of Quran.1570_67 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Muslims believe that even if Muhammad had mistaken&#44; he did it being a human&#44; but he never did any mistake while preaching the sermons of Allah.1570_68 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	After pronouncing the name of the last Prophet Muhammad (SM) the Muslims require to say &quot;Sallalla-hu&#39;alaihi wah sallam&quot;.1570_69 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	Which means; peace be upon him.1570_70 	AE9QK78PC9KRL 	Goddess Lakshmi&#44; the Goddess of wealth is worshipped just after Durga1570_71 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	Apart from this&#44;it is compulsory to say or murmur this as many times as his name is pronounced.1570_72 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Islam teaches the lesson of Dua (prayer) in this way to all Muslims.1570_74 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Hadis is an Arabic word.1570_75 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Its dictionary meaning is &#39;speech&#39;&#44;

subtraction&#44; multiplication and division on it.2099_11 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	These operations on complex number are the expanded form of the operation on real numbers.2099_12 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	But during the application of these operations on complex numbers&#44; a more beautiful and effective characteristics are seen.2099_13 	AAF85ZPWB65DY 	For example&#44; we can get negative real numbers from squaring of some complex(imaginary) numbers.2099_14 	AAF85ZPWB65DY 	Complex numbers were first conceived by the Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano&#44; during his attempts to find solutions to cubic equations.2099_15 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	He termed this as &quot;Imaginary&quot;2099_16 	AAF85ZPWB65DY 	The solution of a general cubic equation in radicals may require intermediate calculations containing the square roots of negative numbers&#44; even when the final solutions are real numbers.2099_18 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	According to this theorem&#44; it is possible to find solution of any polynomial equation of degree one or higher with the help of complex numbers.2099_19 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Rafayal Bomblin an Italian mathematician first discovered the process of addition&#44; subtraction&#44; multiplication or division of the complex numbers.2099_20 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton extended this abstraction of complex number into a theorem.2099_21 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	He developed the complex number theory.2099_22 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Complex numbers are used in a number of engineering fields including Electromagnetism&#44; Quantum Physics&#44; Applied mathematics&#44; chaos theory.2099_23 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	In few case there is only a solution available with complex number.2099_24 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Such as complex analysis&#44; complex matrix&#44; complex polynomial&#44; and complex Lie algebra.2099_26 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Particular procedure.2099_27 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	A complex number is normally expressed with a form&#44; where a and b are the real numbers and i is an imaginary unit which follows the rules.2099_28 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The real number &#39;a&#39; is called the real part of the complex number and the real number b is called the imaginary part of the complex number.2099_30 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	If z=a+ib&#44; then real part a is denoted by Re(z) or (z) and the imaginary part b is denoted by Im(z) or (z).2099_31 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The whole set of the complex numbers is represented by the symbol C.2099_32 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	R&#44; the set of real numbers&#44; can be said to be a sub-set of C&#44; the set of complex numbers&#44; where the real numbers are those complex numbers whose imaginary part is zero.2099_33 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	That is&#44; real number a can be taken into consideration.2099_34 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	The complex numbers whose real part is zero&#44; they are called imaginary numbers&#44; and instead of 0+bi&#44; they are denoted by only bi.2099_35 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	If it is become &#39;and&#39; then instead of writing &#39;or&#39; we can only write the number.2099_36 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	In some cases (specially&#44; in different parts of electrical engineering&#44; where by i current flow is indicated)&#44; the imaginary unit i is instead written as j.2099_37 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	So complex numbers are sometimes seen to have been written by the form a + bj.2099_41 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	According to the Domain Colouring process.2099_42 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The plot of the function f(x) = (x2  1) (x  2  i)2/(x2 + 2 + 2i)2099_43 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Where the argument of the function has been shown with colors and the value of the function has been shown by the density of shadow.2099_45 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Two complex numbers are said to be equal to each other if and only if both the real and the imaginary parts are equal.2099_46 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	In other words&#44; two complex numbers and will be equal to each other if and only if and happens.2099_48 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The account of consecutive pairs of the real numbers2099_49 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	We can represent a complex number by a real number&#44;where the point is on a complex surface&#44; X and Y is the two axis.2099_50 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	In the same way as the real numbers are expressed in a point on the number line .2099_51 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Complex Plane or the Zed Plane is used for complex numbers.2099_52 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In that case the X-axis is assumed along its real part and Y-axis is assumed along the imaginary part of the number.2099_53 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	From here it can easily be understood that every complex number of the form is actually a point along the X-axis of the complex plane and at the same time they are individual real numbers as well.2099_54 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In this way if we move to the positive and negative sides along the X-axis we could find each number of R&#44; that is each of the real numbers.2099_55 	AAF85ZPWB65DY 	This means we can consider the x axis as the common real number line.2099_57 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	From here it is clearly seen that.2099_58 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	If we name the cumulative pair as Z then it can be written.2099_61 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	two complex numbers are equal if they represent same point in complex plane.2099_63 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The results of their multiplication and addition is expressed respectively as:2099_65 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	It is worth mentioned that these two operation described here are two elementary functions&#44;effective on complex number set&#44; which are generated from associative function of real numbers2099_66 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	It means that the operations are not performed in any way.2099_67 	A2WEPQZ7UNOYYF 	Only this operation has been accepted.2099_69 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	And because of this.2099_70 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	That is&#44; the complex number system is actually a &#39;natural extension&#39; of the real number system.2099_81 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Algebraic process.2099_82 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Complex numbers are added&#44; subtracted&#44;

there is multiplicative reverse of  a+bi.2099_96 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	There are real numbers and rational numbers among the other fields.2099_97 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	When each real number a is expressed as a+0i then R&#44; the field of real number&#44; create a sub-field of C&#44; field of complex number.2099_98 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	In Algebra complex number subset &#39;C&#39; can be represented as the subset of complex number set of &#39;R&#39;2099_99 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Description is given below.2324_10 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	However&#44; the family of Unix-like operating systems created on the basis of Linux carnel and using GNU code libraries and tools are commonly called Linux.2324_11 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	In a wider sense&#44; a Linux distribution collectively means the operating system and the huge number of application softwares supplied with it.2324_12 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Installation and updates of the Linux distributions can be done easily on the computer.2324_13 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Though there is a generally impression that only few desktop environment like GNOM and KD are associated with Linux&#44; these are also used in other operating systems (like FreeBSD)2324_14 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Initially only a few enthusiastic people used and developed Linux.2324_15 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Now large corporations like IBM&#44; Sun Microsystems&#44; Hewlett-Packard&#44; Novell etc. have chosen Linux for their servers.2324_16 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	The popularity of Linux is also increasing in the Desktop market.2324_17 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Main reason behind the growth of Linux is safe&#44;dependable and we do not have buy it from a particular seller .2324_19 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Starting from embedded system such as mobile phones&#44; personal video recorders etc to personal desktops or laptops and also super computers-Linux is being used in all environments.2324_21 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Richard Stallman established the GNU Project in 19832324_22 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	The objective of GNU Project was to create one full fledged operating system similar to UNIX by using completely free software2324_23 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	By the early 1990s&#44; GNU was able to collect or make all the components of this operating system.2324_24 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	These components include code libraries&#44; compilers&#44; text editors&#44; a UNIX shell and other different softwares.2324_25 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	But an important ingredient was still missing&#44; and that was the basis or the ingredient of the lowest stage of Kernel Operating System.2324_26 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	In 1990&#44; the GNU project started working on their own kernel GNU Hurd.2324_27 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	According to Thomas Bushnel who was the prime designer of the Hard&#44; the primary project of Gonu was to accept BSD 4.4 light Kernel as the basis of their work.2324_28 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	Looking back&#44; he said&#44; &quot;It is now perfectly obvious to me that this would have succeeded splendidly and the world would be a very different place today.&quot;2324_29 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	But observing the lack of co operation among the Berkeley programmers&#44; Stallman decided to use Mach Microkernel for the Hurd project.2324_31 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Almost at the same time&#44; in 1999&#44; a Finnish student&#44; Linus Torvalds&#44; while studying in the University of Helsinki&#44; started working on another Kernel out of his hobby.2324_32 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	This Kernel was later on developed as the Linux Kernel2324_33 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Linus initially started his work with a simple Unix Operating System named Minx.2324_34 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	The creator of Minix was Andrew Tanenbaum&#44;  a famous teacher of operating system design.2324_35 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	But Tanenbaum did not allow  working directly on his MINIX system for improvement.2324_36 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Hence Linus had to develop a system comparable to Minix2324_37 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Linus&#44; at first&#44; had made a terminal emulator with the help of IA-32 and &#39;C&#39; and by compiling it converted it into a binary shape so that it can be run by booting with a floppy disk out of the operating system.2324_38 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Simultaneously two threads would run in the terminal emulator.2324_39 	A6UOPDHGI9D8D 	one of the thread was used to read the data from serial port(input)&#44;while the other was used to send it to the serial port(output)2324_40 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	When Linus felt the need of writing and reading files from the Disk&#44; he added a complete File System Handler with the emulator.2324_41 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	After that he slowly converted this into a full fledged operating system&#44; so that this can be used as the base for the POSIX Threads related systems2324_43 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	After a short while&#44; the second version was published during the October&#44; 1991.2324_44 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Since then thousands of developers have taken part in this project of Linux2324_45 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In his book The Cathedral and the Bazaar&#44; Eric Raymond has discussed about the model of development process of Linux kernel (and other software of the same category).2324_46 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In the 0.01 version of Linux&#44; Linus has materialize the adequate number of Poxis system call so that Linux can run the GNU Bash Shell.2324_47 	A3BNFNWQX37CQV 	the realization of bootstraping helped in development of linux2324_48 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In the early stages&#44; MINIX running computer was needed to install&#44; configure and compile the Linux.2324_49 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Apart from that&#44; the presence of another operating system was needed to boot the initial versions of Linux from the hard disk.2324_50 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	But soon some self-sufficient boot-loaders were developed to resolve this problem; among these boot-loaders the most commonly known one is Lilo.2324_51 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	After that Linux surpassed MINIX quickly in respect of usefulness.2324_52 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Linus and the other primary developers of Linux made changes in the kernels so that they could work with the several constituents of the GNU and with the programs written for the users.2324_53 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	In this way&#44; Linux slowly started taking the shape of a complete operating system in respect of structure and usefulness.2324_55 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	And the task for the Linux distribution vendors or organizations is to produce a complete operating system by integrating all the elements and adding graphical interface (like X-Window system based GNOME or KDE) and application software.2324_56 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The mascot and logo of Linux is a penguin called &#39;Tux&#39;.2324_57 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	A picture drawn by Larry Ewing in 1996 was the inspiration behind Tux.2324_58 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Besides Tux there are OS-tan and some other characters representing Linux but are not much popular.2324_59 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	However&#44; the name Linux was not given by Linus Torvalds.2324_60 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The credit of naming Linux goes to Ari Lemke.2324_61 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Lemke administered an FTP server called fpt.funet.fi at Helsinki Institute of Technology.2324_62 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The server was a part of Finnish University and Research Network and one of the institutes connected with this network was Linus&#39; University of Helsinki.2324_63 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	When Linus gave his operating system project to Lemke to preserve in this server&#44; Lemke kept it in a directory that he named as &#39;Linux&#39; which is the abbreviated form of &#39;Linus&#39; Minix&#39;.2324_64 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Linux himself wanted to name it &quot;Freax&quot;&#44; which was the mixture of free and &quot;X&quot; from the last part of Unix.2324_65 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	At last the name &#39;Linux&#39; by Lemmke was adopted..2324_67 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Linux kernel and majority of the GNU elements are covered by GNU General Public License (GPL).2324_68 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	All the modification of the source code and its related works are performed under GPL.2324_69 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In 1997 in this respect Linus said&#44;&#39;Bringing Linux under GPL is undoubtedly my best work.2324_70 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	&#39;Other systems associated with Linux use separate licenses&#44; for example&#44; many code libraries use LGPL license and the X-Window system use MIT license.2324_72 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Linus Torvalds of United States is the owner of Linux trademark.2324_73 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Presently&#44; the licensing of the trademark is being handled by the Linux Mark Institute (LMI).2324_74 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	LMI is also trying to establish the Linux trademark in the other countries other than United States.2324_76 	AZVAVU4OYMG2A 	Mutual usability2324_77 	A29I4DG0VTW9X3 	Compatibility of Linux2324_79 	A29I4DG0VTW9X3 	Primarily Linux Kernel had been built only for 386-type processors.2324_80 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Later it is enabled to work under different architecture.2324_83 	A29I4DG0VTW9X3 	x86-64 (AMS&#39;s AMD64 and Intel&#39;s EM64T)2324_85 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)2324_87 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	ESA/390 (Enterprise Systems Architecture/390)2324_89 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages)2324_97 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Command Line Interface2324_98 	A2WEPQZ7UNOYYF 	X Window Manager2324_99 	A2WEPQZ7UNOYYF 	Desktop Environment2459_10 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He received many awards in his colourful career.2459_11 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Among these the most famous one is the honorary Academy Award(Oscar) in 1991 for Lifetime Achievement.2459_16 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit Ray&#44; 19322459_17 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit Ray&#39;s ancestry can be traced back for at least ten generations2459_18 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But from the time of his grandfather Upendrakishore Ray&#44; Satyajith&#39;s family took a historical turn.2459_19 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Writer&#44; illustrator&#44; philosopher&#44; publisher&#44; amateur astronomer Upendrakishore Ray was mainly known as a leader of  the Brahmo Samaj&#44; a religious and social movement of Bengal in the 19th century.2459_20 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Sukumar Ray&#44; Upendrakishore&#39;s son&#44; was a pioneering Bengali writer of nonsense rhyme and children&#39;s literature2459_21 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Sukumar was also famous as a painter and critic.2459_22 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Satyajit Ray&#44; the first son to Sukumar Ray&#44; was born in the year 1921.2459_23 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	When Satyajit was only three years old&#44; he lost his father; his mother Suprabha brought him up amidst many difficulties.2459_25 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	On 1940 Satyajit&#39;s mother requested him to get admitted in Biswa-Bharati Vidyalaya in Shantiniketan established by Rabindranath Tagore.2459_26 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The Kolkata lover Satyajit did not hold a high opinion for the educational environment of Shantiniketan&#44; but finally he agreed due to his mothers insistence as well as his great regard for Rabindranath Tagore.2459_27 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In Santiniketan&#44; Satyajit feels the appreciation for oriental art.2459_28 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Later he admitted that he learnt lots of things from the famous painters Nandalal Bose and Benode Behari Mukherjee.2459_29 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Later Satyajit made a documentary on Benode Behari Mukherjee.2459_30 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	His respect for the Indian art grew after he travelled to Ajanta&#44; Elora and Elephanta.2459_34 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit in his Shantiniketon years.2459_35 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Although Satyjait was supposed to complete a five years course in Visva-Bharati University&#44; In 1943&#44; he left Shantiniketon and joined a British-run advertising agency in Kolkata&#44; D.J. Keymer&#44; as a &quot;junior visualiser&quot;&#44; earning just eighty rupees a month2459_36 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Although on the one hand&#44; visual design was something close to Ray&#39;s heart and&#44; for the most part&#44; he was treated well&#44; there was palpable tension between the British and Indian employees of the firm (the former were much better paid)&#44; and Ray felt that &quot;the clients were generally stupid&quot;.2459_37 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Soon after&#44; Ray also became involved with Signet Press&#44; a new publishing house started up by D. K. Gupta.2459_38 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Gupta asked Ray to create cover designs for books published from Signet Press and gave him complete artistic freedom2459_40 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Apart from that&#44; he also worked on Am Antir Bhepu&#44; a children&#39;s version of Pather Panchali novel written by classic Bengali novel writer&#44; Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay.2459_41 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Satyajit was deeply influenced by this novel and decided to make it the subject of his first film.2459_42 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In addition to designing the cover&#44; he illustrated the book;2459_43 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	These illustrations later found their place as shots in his most popular film.2459_44 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Along with Chidananda Dasgupta and others&#44; Satyajit founded the Calcutta Film Society in 19472459_45 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	As a member of this society he was exposed to many foreign films2459_46 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Throughout this time&#44; Ray continued to watch and study films seriously.2459_47 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	During World War II&#44; he befriended the American soldiers staying in Kolkata and he collected information from them on new American Films reaching the city.2459_48 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	He came to know a RAF employee&#44; Norman Clare&#44; who shared Ray&#39;s passion of films&#44; chess and western classical music2459_49 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In 1949&#44; Ray married Bijoya Das&#44; his first cousin and longtime sweetheart2459_50 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	They gave birth to a son named Sandip Roy who is also a great film maker of the present time.2459_52 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Satyajit helped Renoir to find the locations in the villages.2459_53 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	At that time&#44; Satyajit talked with Renoir about filming of &#39;Pather Panchali&#39; and Renoir encouraged him to proceed with the matter.2459_54 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In 1950 D.J. Kemer had sent Satyaji to work at their head office in London.2459_55 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	During the three months of his stay in London&#44; Satyajit watched almost 99 films.2459_56 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Among them the Italian neo-realistic film &#39;Ladri di biciclette&#39; (&#39;cycle thief&#39;) influenced him deeply.2459_57 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Later Satyajit told&#44; while coming out from the cinema hall after watching this movie&#44; he decided to be a film maker.2459_58 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Years of Apu (1950-58)2459_61 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The scene of large inquisitive eyes was repeated again and again in &#39; The Apu Trilogy&#39;.2459_62 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Satyajit decided that &#39;Pather Pancahli&#39; the classical &#39;Bildungsroman&#39; of Bengali literature would be the object of his first film.2459_63 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	This autobiography written by Bibhuti Bhusan Banerjee and published in 1928 was a story of growth from youth to adulthood of the Apu&#44; a Bengali village boy.2459_64 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	To make this film&#44; Satyajit gathered some inexperienced film technicians&#44; though later his cameraman Subrata Mitra and production designer Bansi Chandragupta became famous in their own fields.2459_66 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	At the end of the year 1952&#44; Satyajit started shooting with his own money from his savings.2459_67 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He was hoping that somebody would invest after watching these initial scenes.2459_68 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	But no such financial help was available.2459_69 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Pather Panchaliwas shot over the unusually long period of three years&#44; because shooting was possible only from time to time2459_70 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Shooting was possible only when Satyajit or the Production Manager Anil Choudhury could collect the required money.2459_71 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	At last&#44; in 1955 the production of the film was completed by taking loan from the West Bengal government&#44; and it was released the same year.2459_72 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Just after release the film got unequivocal appreciation of both the audience and the critics and won a number of awards.2459_73 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The film was shown for a long time both within and outside India.2459_74 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	During production&#44; Satyajit did not honor any request of changing screenplay in exchange for money.2459_75 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Even he ignored a request from the Government of West Bengal for a happy ending (where at the end of the film&#39;s story Apu&#39;s family joined a &quot;development project&quot;) of the film.2459_76 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Reaction to the film in India was encouraging.2459_78 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In the United Kingdom&#44; Lindsay Anderson wrote a glowing review of the film.2459_79 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	However&#44; not all the criticisms were so positive.2459_80 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Franois Truffaut is reported to have said&#44; &quot;I dont want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands.&quot;2459_81 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Bosley Crowther&#44; then the most influential critic of The New York Times&#44; wrote a scathing review of the film that its distributor Ed Harrison thought would kill off the film when it got released in the United States&#44;2459_82 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	but instead it enjoyed an exceptionally long run.2459_83 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit&#39;s international career started in earnest after the success of his next film&#44; Aparajito (The Unvanquished).2459_84 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In this film the traditional conflict between the ambition of young Apu and his mother&#39;s love has been portrayed in a heartbreaking manner.2459_85 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Many critics&#44; notably Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak&#44; rank it even higher than the first film.2459_86 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The film &#39;Aparajito&#39; won the Golden Lion award in Venice.2459_87 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Before the completion of The Apu Trilogy&#44; Satyajit completed two other films2459_88 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The first is a comedy named Parash Pathar (The Philosopher&#39;s Stone)&#44;2459_90 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	When Satyajit was making the film &#39;Aparajito&#39; he did not think of making a trilogy&#44; but it came into his mind after hearing the questions from the journalists in Venice about this.2459_91 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The final installation of the series&#44; Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) was made in 19592459_92 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Like the other two movies&#44; this one was also claimed as the best film in these series ( Robin Wood&#44; Aparna Sen).2459_93 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	With this picture&#44; Satyajit&#39;s2459_94 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit introduced two of his favourite actors Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore2459_95 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The film finds Apu living in a nondescript Kolkata house in near-poverty2459_96 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The marriage between Apu and Aparna happened in an unusual situation.2459_97 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In different scenes of their life&#44;&quot;one of the cinema&#39;s classic affirmative depictions of married life&quot; was exposed&#44; but quickly tragedy followed.2459_98 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	A Bengali critic harshly criticized Apur Sansar&#44; and Satyajit wrote an article defending it which was a rare event in Satyajits film making career (another similar incident took place regarding his favorite film Charulata).2459_99 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Success in his career did not affect his personal life.2548_10 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	Side by side honoring talented students&#44;mathematics contest&#44;language competition etc.2548_11 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	As an associate to Pratham Alo (the first light) there is job website &#39;Pratham Alo Jobs Dot Com&#39;

V. Raman&#44; Amartya Sen and so on.2730_23 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	The Kalighat Temple was established in 1887 AD&#44; according to a   opinion from the word &quot;Kalikhetro&quot; the name &quot;Kolikata&quot; was born.2730_25 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Its Bengali name &quot;Kolkata&quot; and the English name &quot;Calcutta&quot; both have their origin from this name of &quot;Kolikata&quot;.2730_26 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	There are conflicts among experts on the origin of the name Kolkata.2730_27 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	According to one opinion the word &#39;Kolikata&#39; has originated from &#39;Kalikshetra&#39; which means the &#39;kingdom of Goddess Kali&#39;.2730_28 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Alternatively&#44; the name may have been derived from the Bengali term kilkila (&quot;flat area&quot;).2730_29 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Again&#44; the name may have its origin in the indigenous term for a natural canal&#44; Khal&#44; followed by Katta (which may mean dug).2730_30 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Another theory is that the place used to specialize in quicklime (kali chun) and coir rope (kt) and hence the place was called Kalikt2730_31 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Etymologist Sukumar Sen has given a complete different theory for the origin of the name &quot;Kalikata&quot;2730_32 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	According to him:2730_33 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The name Calcutta came from two Arabic words taken from Parsi - &#39;Qali&#39; means unrest or fool and &#39;Qatta&#39; means culprits or murderers.2730_34 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	This version of the name was very appropriate.2730_35 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Because the marshland and the jungles on the eastern side of the river Ganges was the hiding place for the pirates&#44; Dacoits and other local and foreign miscreants2730_37 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Some people have identified this alteration of the name of this city as an effort of wiping out the inheritance of the British origin of the city.2730_38 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Many foreign media never accepted this change.2730_39 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	But BBC has accepted the names &quot;Mumbai&quot;

village was mentioned in this list as appeared in the book Ain-I-Akbar written by Abul Fazal.2730_64 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Apart from that the name of Kolkata village is also mentioned in a Persian book&#44; Riyaz-us-Salatin written by Ghulam Hussain in 1786.2730_65 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In 1690 the British East India Company came to this area to expand their business in Bengal.2730_66 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	From this time onwards starts the written history of Kolkata City.2730_67 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Imperialistic historians think that Job Charnock&#44; an administrator with the Company was the founder of Kolkata.2730_68 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	However modern researchers have recently confuted this opinion.2730_69 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) suit of 2003&#44; the Calcutta High Court had clearly directed that no specific person should have been regarded to the founder of the city of Calcutta.2730_71 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In the latter half of the 7th century AD the region of Calcutta was divided into three villages named Sutanuti&#44; Gobindapur and Dihi Kolikata.2730_72 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Those three villages were under the direct control of the Nawab (king) of Bengal.2730_73 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	At this time the British officials planned to build a fort in Gobindapur to defeat their contestant powers&#44; the Dutch&#44; the Portuguese&#44; and the French.2730_74 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The construction of Fort William was completed in 1702.2730_75 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	This fort was an army base as well as a regional headquarter.2730_76 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Calcutta was declared as the &quot;Presidency City&quot; and later became the headquarter of the Bengal Presidency.2730_77 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	At this time&#44; conflicts between the French and the British occurred frequently.2730_78 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In 1756 the British started renovation of Fort William to inhibit the French.2730_79 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Though the then emperor of Bengal&#44; Siraj-Ud-Daulah made an objection to this&#44; the British officials did not take it seriously.2730_80 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	After that Siraj attacked on Kolkata and occupied the Fort and detained the Englishmen from Kolkata.2730_81 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Immediately afterwards the British made the infamous propaganda of &#39;Black Well Murder&#39;.2730_83 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In 1772 Kolkata was declared the capital of British India.2730_84 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Later from 1864&#44; the practice of temporarily relocating the capital to the hill city Simla of Uttartakhand in the summer season was begun.2730_85 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In the beginning of 19th century marshes around Kolkata were filled up.2730_86 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Government Place or Office Para was established in the littoral area of Hooghly River2730_87 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	During the rule of Lord Wellesley (Governor General 1797-1805) there had been a considerable growth of cities.2730_88 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	During his time construction of many government buildings was started.2730_89 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The beautiful architecture and the huge structure of these buildings gave Kolkata a new name as &quot;Prasad Nagari&quot; or City Of Palaces&quot;.2730_90 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Calcutta was also the center of opium trading of the British East India Company in the 18th and 19th century.2730_91 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Locally cultivated opium were all auctioned in Calcutta and then they were shipped to be transported to China.2730_92 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Renaissance of Bengal2730_93 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In the beginning of the 19th century the city of Calcutta was divided into two parts.2730_95 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The city underwent rapid industrial growth from the 1850s&#44; especially in the textile and jute sectors;2730_96 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	As a result of this the British government had invested a huge capital in the infrastructure development projects like the projects of rails and telegraphs.2730_97 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	DUE TO THE CULTURAL EXCHANGE AND MIXING UP OF BRITISH AND INDIAN CULTURE&#44; A NEW CATEGORY OF HIGH CLASS BENGALI HIGH CLASS PEOPLE EMERGED IN THE BENGALI SOCIETY.2730_98 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	These babus were mainly upper caste Hindus&#44; educated in English and readers of newspapers.2730_99 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	By occupation they were Land owners&#44; Government employees and Teachers.3043_10 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	There is such a misconception that open source software is only developed by volunteers.3043_11 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	It is true that most of the open source softwares are made by volunteers&#44; but there are exceptions to this.3043_13 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	Software service means customization of the software&#44; development&#44; selling instruction manual and providing training&#44; etc.3043_14 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The most successful open source company is perhaps Red Hat.3043_15 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Among the renowned institutions who provide open source services are: I.B.M.&#44; Sun Microsystems etc.3043_17 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Open source org website.34310_3 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Wikimedia Foundation (San Francisco)34310_4 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Wikimedia Foundation is an international non-profit organization.34310_5 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Its main office is in San Francisco&#44;California in USA.34310_6 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	This organisation was initially started in Florida and organized under the laws of the state of Florida.34310_8 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Among these there are: Wikipedia&#44;

2003 the formation of the foundation was officially announced by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales&#44; who had been operating Wikipedia under the guidance of Bomis Company.3502_10 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In the ancient times human beings would use oyster&#44; pebbles&#44; knots on a rope etc to express numbers.3502_11 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Afterwards&#44; though different techniques and machines were used for computations&#44; Abacus&#44; an old calculating device&#44; is recognized as the first such machine in the history of computers.3502_12 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Hence&#44; the history of computer starts from the abacus.3502_13 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Abacus is a machine in which beads are moved in the frame in order to do calculation.3502_14 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	It was originated as a calculating tool in Egypt/China in 450/500 BC.3502_15 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In 1617 the mathematician of Scotland John Napier introduced  printed and crossed marked sticks for counting.3502_16 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	These rods are known as Napier&#39;s bones.3502_18 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	He introduced the method of addition or subtraction through gears or wheels with nails.3502_19 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In 1671 the German mathematician Gottfried Von Leibniz had made a more sophisticated calculator on the basis of Pascal&#39;s machine and by using the wheels and sticks which was able to divide and multiply as well.3502_21 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	He named the machine as Rechoning Machine.3502_22 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Even if the machine was theoretically good but it did not become popular due to its mechanical inconveniences.3502_23 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Later in 1820 Thomas De Colmar made Leibniz&#39;s machine popular by resolving the problem of Reckoning machine.3502_24 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	After that Charles Babage&#44; a Professor of Mathematics of Cambridge University of England had invented the Difference Engine or the subtracting machine in 1823.3502_25 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	To make it a little easy--3502_26 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The word Computer came from The Greek word Compute.3502_27 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The word Compute means accounting or calculating.3502_28 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	And the meaning of the word &#39;Computer&#39; is Calculating machine.3502_29 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But now the computer cannot be called Calculating machine only.3502_31 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	The first computer came to our country on the year 1964.3502_32 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Computer System3502_33 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	A system is a combination of some integrated devices which work to serve some general purposes.3502_34 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The components of computer system are as follows:3502_37 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	3. Humanware or the users3502_38 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	4. Data/Information3502_40 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	All of the machines&#44; machineries and devises of a computer which have their own external forms are called hardware.3502_41 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The computer hardware can primarily be divided into three parts:3502_43 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	B* System Unit: Hard Disk&#44; Mother Board&#44; AGP Card etc.3502_44 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	C* Output Devices: Monitor&#44; Printer&#44; Disk&#44; Speaker etc.3502_46 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Sequentially set instructions for solving any problem or work is called &quot;Program&quot; in computer language.3502_47 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Software is a program or programming systems which enable the computer hardware and the user to generate a communication between them and thus to make the hardware work for the users.3502_48 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	Computer software mainly can be divided into two categories.3502_49 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	a) System software: System software co-ordinates different applications of different units of software and maintains  balance in successful flow of data from the hardware which maintains the actual performance of the computer.3502_50 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	b) Application software: The programme used to solve application related  problems or the programme used for data encryption is known as application software.3502_51 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Different types of ready made software are available in the market like the commercial products to solve applied problems which are usually called package program.3502_52 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	Humanware or users.3502_53 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	THE WORK FORCE OR PEOPLE INVOLVED COLLECTION OF DATA&#44;PROGRAMMING AND EXPERIMENTATION&#44; OPERATING COMPUTER AND DESCRIBING ITS PROGRAMME&#44; SYSTEM DESIGNING&#44;RECORDING AND UPDATION&#44; CO-ORDINATING BETWEEN COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ETC ARE KNOWN AS HUMANWARE.3502_55 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	The smallest unit of Information is called data.3502_56 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	Data is unorganized Raw Fact. Data are mainly two types-3502_57 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	a) Numeric Data3502_58 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	For example - 25&#44; 100&#44; 456 etc.3502_60 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	Example - names of Man&#44; country&#44; etc.&#44; job&#44; nations or pictures&#44; sound and date etc.3502_61 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	Operating system3502_62 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Operating system is a software which control computer execution and which control the work like scheduling&#44; debugging&#44; input/output control&#44; accounting&#44; compilation&#44; storage&#44; data management and other related work.3502_63 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	Currently most used operating systems used in micro computer or PC are-3502_66 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Computer has lots of uses&#44;3502_67 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	It has got a wide use in various sectors starting from domestic works to different essential purposes like commercial&#44; scientific works.3502_69 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	It plays an important role in health and human welfare.3502_70 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In one word computer is a machine which is able to do almost all the work.3502_72 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	On the basis of functionality computers can be classified into two main divisions.3502_73 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	general-purpose computers3502_74 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Special purpose computers3502_75 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Again&#44; a computer can further be divided into three types according to its structure and usages.3502_76 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Analog Computers.3502_77 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Digital Computers.3502_78 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Hybrid Computers.3502_79 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Digital computers can be divided into four groups on the basis of its size&#44; capacity&#44; price and importance of usage.3502_82 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Micro Computers.3502_83 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Super Computers.3502_84 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The complete classifications of the computers are shown below:3502_85 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Analog Computer3502_86 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The computer that can measure one physical quantity with respect to another quantity is called Analog Computer.3502_87 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	It can record temperature or other continuously changing physical property.3502_88 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The speedometer of motor vehicle is an excellent example of Analog Computer.3502_89 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Digital Computer3502_90 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The computer which solves problem by using digits is called Digital Computer.3502_91 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	It can do any mathematical addition and subtraction&#44; multiplication&#44; and division.3502_93 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Hybrid computer is a computer which has characteristics of both analog and digital computer.3502_94 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	It is used for scientific research .3502_95 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Therefore it can be said that from the side of technology that Hybrid Computer is a small part of Analogue and Digital Computer.3502_96 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Mainframe Computer3502_97 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Mainframe computer is a large computer which can be connected with many smaller computers to avail many works ar the same time.3502_98 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This computer is useful for scientific researches&#44; high level technological analysis and large industrial organizations.3502_99 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Department of Statistic of Dhaka University and The Atomic Energy Commission of Bangladesh use this sort of computers-- cyber 170&#44;

demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good1218_154 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good.1218_155 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In this case the term &#39;Utility Maximization Constraint&#39;

Chanakya&#44; Kin si Huang&#44; Thomas Aquinus&#44; Ibone Khaldun etc are among  the old writers of economic thoughts1218_239 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Joseph Sumpeter had considered the learned persons of 14th to 17th century to be &quot;the founders of most correct scientific economy that those others preceded to him&quot; like he had invented the theory of rate of interest and price in accordance with the law of nature.1218_240 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Joseph Schumpeter described Ibn Khaldun as &quot;coming nearer than any other group to being the &#39;founders&#39; of scientific economics&quot;1218_241 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	But many of his economic theories are still unknown in Europe.1218_283 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Classical economics focused on the tendency of markets to move to long-run equilibrium.1218_284 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Marxist Economics1218_285 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Main Article: Marxist Economics1218_286 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The Marxist school of economic thought comes from the work of German economist Karl Marx.1218_287 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In classical economics&#44; the introduction of Marxian economics is a turning point in the history of world economics.1218_288 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	It derives from the work of Karl Marx.1218_289 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The first volume of Marx&#39;s major work&#44; Das Kapital&#44; was published in German in 1867.1218_291 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Therefore&#44; in the capitalist world&#44; the labor theory of value is more effective than the general theory of price&#44; though this is kept silence in the political economics.1218_292 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	New Basic Economics1218_303 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Keynesian Economics1218_304 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Main Article: Keynesian Economics1218_305 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Keynesian economics derives from John Maynard Keynes&#44; in particular his book The General Theory of Employment&#44; Interest and Money (1936)&#44; which ushered in contemporary macroeconomics as a distinct field1218_306 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The main proposal of  Keynesian Economics is to take expansion measures by the Government to counter economic depression.1218_307 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The book focused on the subject of determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible.1218_308 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labour-market unemployment might not be self-correcting due to low &quot;effective demand&quot; and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing1218_309 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Hence this book is termed revolutionary in its impact on economic analysis.1218_310 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Keynesian economics has two successors1218_311 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Post-Keynesian economics also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes1218_323 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	The definition of wealth1218_324 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	The detailed definition of wealth is related to the initial discussion of the political economics of David Hume and Adam Smith.1218_325 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Hume justified that apart from increase in production excess gold can increase the cost.1218_326 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	However&#44; according to Smith&#44;excess gold or silver does not represent wealth&#44; which is actually the annual production of labor and land of a society.1218_327 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	John Stuat Mill defined economics as &quot;the practical science of production and distribution of wealth&quot;.1218_328 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	This definition has been accepted by Concise Oxford English Dictionary&#44; which does not include the main principle of consumption.1218_329 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	To Mill&#44; wealth is a storage of important materials.1218_330 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	Production and consumption have been given more importance while defining wealth.1218_331 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	This emphasis has been criticized by the critics as keeping the human at the background and bringing the wealth into lime light.1218_332 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	For example&#44; it can be stated that John Ruskin called political economy as science of the rich or an illegitimate science.1218_384 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The definition of economics is criticized by saying that it is lowly materialistic.1218_386 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	A labour theory entirely neglects the aggregate of non-materialistic services which makes it imperfect.1218_387 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Welfare can&#39;t be measured quantitatively because marginal utility of money is quite different to the rich and the poor (Fox example&#44; to a poor Rs. 100 is far more valuable than a rich).1218_388 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	Also production and distribution of commodities such as alcohol and smoking goods does not help human welfare&#44; but these insignificant commodities naturally satisfies people&#39;s demand and wishes.1218_389 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In the Marxist Economy&#44; the definition of the welfare is still being emphasized.1218_390 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In addition&#44; in criticizing idealistic economics it is stated that present economic discussions are not sufficient to measure welfare but welfare of monetary economists achieved imperfect success.1218_391 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The neo-classical economy concentrates on the scarcity in continuous control which is in vogue in most of the departments of institutional economy.1218_392 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In recent years it has been criticized on different occasions along with institutional economics&#44; developmental economics and surplus economics.1218_393 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Economy and Politics1218_414 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	Due to this concept&#44; it is presumed that it is inhuman and this type of subject can not be included in Economics.1218_415 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	For this reason State Representatives of the U.S. regularly meet on economic analytical research.1218_418 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In many cases of economics it is stated that preference is to be considered without past will&#44; sometimes social conditions are imposed as people want to lead an honorable life.1218_419 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In the economic process this is an extremely debatable matter which influences and create expected reactions on the process of welfare.1218_420 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	In an impartial observation&#44;may be identified as the reasons for failure of economic influences.1218_421 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Their logic is that the redistribution of resources is economically and humanly wrong.1218_422 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	From the socialist point of view it is an economic failure in social field.1218_423 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Their logic is that the inequality of wealth is not acceptable in the primary discussion.1218_434 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	In most of the universities and colleges there is a main school or department which gives the institutional importance to the subject like Department of Arts&#44; Department of Commerce.1218_435 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	&quot;Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel&quot; (which is also known as the Nobel Prize in Economics) is an annual prize for the economists which is conferred on them for their knowledgeable contribution in this subject.1218_436 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The economists are employed in different private sectors like industry&#44;

American foreign department accused India for the fight in the subcontinent.1495_201 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	At the meeting of the National council&#44; American representative George H.W.Bush presented a proposal for immediate cease-fire&#44; withdrawal of Indian and Pakistani army and to give a power to the Chief secretary of the united nation to bring this proposal into effect.1495_202 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Soviet representative had applied the veto by stating this to be a unilateral proposal.1495_203 	A9H4GEUPLSQ3M 	Poland also voted against the proposal.1495_204 	A9H4GEUPLSQ3M 	France and Britain also abstained from voting.1495_205 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In the next day&#44; the 5th December&#44; when the session of the Security Council started again&#44; in one of the proposals of the Soviet Union it was stated that in the East Pakistan there was a need of such a solution through which the present violence would definitely be ended there and the disturbance created out of the violence of the Pakistani Army that too needed to be stopped.1495_207 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	China voted against it.1495_208 	A9H4GEUPLSQ3M 	All other nations abstained from voting.1495_209 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In the same day&#44; another proposal was raised in the Security Council from another 8 countries demanding cease fire and army withdrawal.1495_210 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	At this&#44; the Soviet Union exercised its second veto.1495_211 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	At the same time&#44; the Soviet government&#44; with a statement&#44; demanded the legal rights of the people of the East Bengal and acceptance of their interest through political settlement; the Soviet Union also stated that since this unrest was adjacent to their country&#44; the question of their own security is tangled with it and also called for all the nations of the world not to associate themselves with these contending parties so that the situation could not be further deteriorated.1495_212 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	International Acceptance1495_213 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	On December 6 diplomatic recognition of Bangladesh was officially announced by the Indian Government.1495_214 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	At 11 O&#39;clock in the morning it was declared through the All India Radio that India had accepted Bangladesh as a sovereign state.1495_215 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	While introducing the proposal for  recognition of Bangladesh at a special session of the Indian parliament&#44; Indira Gandhi said &quot;the united revolt of all the people of Bangladesh and success of the movement has gradually made it clear that the so called mother-country Pakistan is completely unable to bring back the people of Bangladesh under it&#39;s control&quot;.1495_216 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In regard to recognition of Bangladesh it can be stated that the whole world is conscious that they reflect the desire of the great majority of people&#44; but many governments representing its people can&#39;t claim that.1495_217 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	According to the highly famous words of Jefferson to the Governor Morris the government of Bangladesh is supported by the &quot;complete manifested wills of the nation or the will of the nation&quot;.1495_220 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	On December 4 the temporary President and the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Saiyad Nazrul Islam and Tajuddin Ahmed respectively wrote jointly a letter requesting Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to officially recognize Bangladesh.1495_221 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	In reply to the letter of 4th December&#44; prime minister Indira Gandhi sent a letter to  prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed about the recognition of Bangladesh&#44;whose partial Bengali translation are as follows:1495_222 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	&quot;May the truth alone triumph&quot;1495_223 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Prime Minister1495_225 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	December 6&#44;

General A.A.K.Niazi&#44;Chief of Pakistani Armed Forces in Bangladesh signed the surrender document in presence of thousands of delighted people at the Racecourse field (presently Sarwardi garden).1495_266 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Almost 93&#44;000 Pakistani soldiers surrendered which was the largest surrender event after World War II.1495_267 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	People of Bangladesh achieved their long desired victory nine months after the beginning of liberation war.1495_268 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Though the Pakistani Army had surrender on 16th December&#44; it took up to 22nd December to get all the Pakistanis surrendered in the whole country.1495_269 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The day Pakistani navy surrendered&#44; the seventh naval fleet entered the southern end of Bay of Bengal.1495_270 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	But at that time Bangladesh was completely free from the ties of Pakistani rule.1495_272 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	During the struggle for freedom&#44; such barbaric massacre of innocent people has never been witnessed in the history of Bangladesh.1495_273 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	On 25th March the operation Searchlight started by Pakistani soldiers in Kalora that ended before Bangladesh got its freedom killed many Bengalis with the help of some terrorism.1495_274 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Still there is doubt about the casualty fugure During Muktijuddho.1495_275 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In several books and encyclopaedia throughout the world this number is mentioned from 200 thousands up to 3 millions.1495_276 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	In The Bangladesh Liberation War almost 30&#44;00&#44;000 people died.1495_277 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	During the war&#44;

on December 14 Razakar&#44; Al-Badar and Al-Sams forces on the instruction Pakistani army captured and brutally killed almost 300 intellectuals in Bangladesh which included teachers&#44; doctors&#44; engineers&#44; artists&#44; poets&#44; writers&#44;scientists.1495_281 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Pakistan&#39;s boot leaking traitor Razakar group of Bangladesh could sense the fate of war at the beginning of December and committed this well planned massacre just before independence.1495_282 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	Their main motive was to stop the developed process of newly independent Bangladesh by killing the intellectuals.1495_283 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The dead bodies of the intellectuals killed on December 14 were thrown in mass burials of which Rayerbazar is an important one (now the Martyred Intellectuals Monument has been built in this killing ground).1495_285 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The telegram sent to the States Department of the United States by American Consulate in Dhaka mentioned this brutal killing of the students of Dhaka University and the common people on the night of starting war.1495_286 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	During the liberation struggle a large number of Bengali women lost their modesty of which the number is not properly known.1495_287 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	It is presumed in Bangladesh that about 200&#44;000 women were raped during the liberation war and gave birth to many war babies.1495_288 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Pakistani army captured a large number of women most of whom were students of Dhaka university and girls of ordinary families and took them to Dhaka Cantonment.1495_289 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	International reaction1495_290 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	United States and Soviet Russia1495_291 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	United States was the main ally of Pakistan in the year 1971 and during the war the United States helped Pakistan both politically and physically.1495_292 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The then United States President Richard Nixon addressed the liberation war as the internal matter of Pakistan and said that they cannot do anything to control the situation.1495_293 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But assuming Pakistan&#39;s unavoidable defeat&#44; Nixon sent the USS Enterprise to the Bay of Bengal which was addressed by the Indians as a nuclear threat.1495_294 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The Enterprise reached its destination on 11 December 1971.1495_295 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In response to this threat of the USA&#44; Soviet had sent two nuclear submarines from Vladivostok to the Bay of Bengal on 6th and 13 December respectively; this two submarines had been chasing the US Task Force 74 from 18th December till 7th January&#44; 1972 through the Bay of Bengal.1495_299 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	Nixon and Henry Kissinger feared Soviet expansion in the South and South-East Asia.1495_300 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Pakistan was a close friend of the People&#39;s Republic of China&#44; with whom Nixon was planning to improve the relationship and was having a plan to visit China in February 1972.1495_301 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would mean total Soviet domination of the region&#44; and that it would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America&#39;s new tacit ally&#44; China.1495_302 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In order to demonstrate to China the bona fides of the United States as an ally&#44; and in direct violation of the US Congress-imposed sanctions on Pakistan&#44; Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan&#44; while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan1495_303 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the genocidal activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan&#44; most notably the Blood telegram.1495_304 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The Soviet Union supported Bangladesh and helped the Indian army and the Liberation Army during the war.1495_305 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	The Soviet intention was to weaken her rival U.S.A.and China&#44; once Bangladesh achieve independence.1495_306 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	The Soviet Union assured India that if U.S.A. or China get involved in the war&#44;they would take appropriate action against that.1495_307 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In this light&#44; the Indo-Soviet treaty was signed in August 1971.1495_308 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The Soviets also sent a nuclear submarine to ward off the threat posed by USS Enterprise in the Indian Ocean.1495_311 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Assuming Indian invasion&#44; Nixon encouraged China to post its armed forces along its border with India to discourage the fight between India and Pakistan but China did not take such action and started pressurizing for an immediate ceasefire because they did not forget their heavy losses during the 1962 Sino-Indian War despite its victory.1495_312 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But China continues to help Pakistan by supplying arms and aid.1495_313 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	It is assumed that&#44; if that time China had taken any action against India to protect Pakistan then the Soviet Union also would have taken military action against China.1495_314 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	According to one Pakistani writer&#44; China abstained from attacking India as during November and December the mountain passes remained closed due to snowfall.1495_316 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Though the United Nations always protested against human rights violations&#44; they could not solve the issue politically before the war began.1495_317 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	The Security Council of the United Nations discussed the situation of South Asia in its meeting on December 4.1495_318 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	After a prolonged discussion on December 7&#44; it called for immediate suspension of war and removal of armed forces according to the decision it made on the basis of majority opinion of the General Assembly.1495_319 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	United States of America called for another meeting of the Security Council on 12 December.1495_320 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But while the meeting was going on and before it took any final decision&#44; the war was over so the meeting did not have any importance except academically.1495_321 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	This negligence of United Nation regarding the crisis of East Pakistan was severely criticized.1495_323 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	Sculptures of Liberation War (Mukti Juddha)1495_324 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Angeekar&#44;

electronic engineering was known as radio engineering.1505_119 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Its work was limited to radar&#44; commercial radio and ancient television.1505_120 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	When the development of user centric machineries started after World War II then this engineering stream started to expand and modern divisional&#44; audio system&#44; computer and microscope were included in this.1505_121 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	From the mid of the 1950s the name of radio technology were slowly being changed to be renamed as electronics technology by the end of the decade.1505_122 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Before the invention of the Integrated Circuit (IC) in 1959&#44; the electronics circuits were made with large shaped separate machineries.1505_123 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The circuits built with bigger parts used take a lot of space and consume lot of power.1505_124 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The speed of these machineries were also very slow.1505_125 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	On the other hand&#44; Integrated Circuits are a number of very small electronic machineries&#44; the most of which are made up of transistors.1505_126 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The integrated Circuits are prepared with tiny electrical components concerted into a small chip around the size of a coin.1505_127 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Presently most of the electronic devices and modern computers are built with integrated Circuits or IC.1505_128 	A1JLK9H341BM2K 	Microelectronics1505_130 	A1JLK9H341BM2K 	These electronic instruments are used to manufacture a bigger instrument or sometimes it itself is the instrument.1505_131 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The most used and common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors.1505_132 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But most of the electronic components such as resistors&#44; capacitors&#44; inductors etc can be created at a microscopic level.1505_133 	A1JLK9H341BM2K 	Nearly every micro electronics parts are manufactured after mixing some chemicals in definite proportions with silicon at the atomic stage and is made into highly desired magnetic properties.1505_134 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Hence there is a close relationship among microelectronics with the quantum mechanics and chemistry.1505_135 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Signal Processing1505_136 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	From the name itself it is understood that signal processing acts mainly as electrical analysis and representation.1505_137 	A29I4DG0VTW9X3 	There are two kinds of signal.1505_138 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The first one is analog signals where it continuously changes according to the information.1505_139 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Second one is digital signal where signal discretely changed base on information and continuously changed base on value.1505_140 	A29I4DG0VTW9X3 	Signal processing refers to audio signal amplification and filtration for analogue signal and signal modulation and demodulation for Telecommunication.1505_142 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Telecommunication1505_143 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Telecommunication works by sending and receiving information through wire which is co-axial cable&#44; optical fiber or by using satellite.1505_144 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	To send an information through satellite information must be convert into a signal frequency(carrier frequency).1505_145 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This process is called modulation.1505_146 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Among the well known analog modulations techniques worth mentioning are the amplitude modulation and the frequency modulation1505_147 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	The efficiency and the cost of some communication system depend on the  modulation technique used.1505_148 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Efficient systems are generally expensive.1505_149 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Hence it is the responsibility of the technologist to maintain a balance by reducing the cost along with creating an efficient system.1505_150 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	After determining the characteristics of a communication system the telecommunication technologists map the transmitter and receiver used in the system1505_151 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	Sometime the receiver and transmitter equipments are joined to form a two-way communication device called transceiver.1505_152 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	While designing the transmitter&#44;

his poems took on a lyrical quality&#44; speaking via the maner manus (the Buls&#39; &quot;man within the heart&quot;)1528_240 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	The connecting link has met the ultimate truth through the dramatic emotions of nature and human character.1528_241 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The same style has been used by the poet in poems written under the name of Bhanusingha.1528_242 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Throughout the later seventy years of his life&#44; the poet has time and again mad changes in these poems which are based on the love of Radha and Lord Krishna.1528_243 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Through a number of his writings during the decade of 1930&#44;

later on he adopted the colloquial Bengali used by the common people as the language of his poetries.1528_246 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	His other famous compilations are: Manasi&#44; Sonar Tari&#44; Balaka and Purabi etc.1528_247 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	In the poem Sonar Tori the poet has expressed the short lived identity of his life and work1528_248 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The unforgettable last two lines of this poem are - &quot;Left lying on the bank of lonely river&#44;   The golden boat went away with everything I had.&quot;1528_249 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	In the whole world&#44; Rabindranaths most famous book is Gitanjali.1528_250 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He got a Nobel Prize for this book of poetry collections.1528_255 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The signature of Rabindranath;

phase as spontaneous expression of life.1528_268 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Rabindranath had collected the plots of these stories from the lives of the common villagers by traveling to the different parts of their family estates located in Patisar&#44; Sajadpur and Silaidaha and mingling with those people there.1528_270 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	And so these stories claim to be very unique in Indian literature.1528_271 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	&quot;Kabuliwala&quot; is a story of a fruit seller of Kabul in the points of view of a city dweller.1528_272 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	At one stage of this story we could find the intense craving for free life style in a hilly forests by retiring from the congested city life: &quot;Now it is white and fresh Autumn.1528_273 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In ancient times&#44; in this season kings used to set off in their conquest.1528_274 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	I never went anywhere leaving Calcutta and that is why my mind always travels the whole world.1528_275 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	I am somewhat always living in the corner of our house&#44; and my mind always desires to go to the outside world.1528_276 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Whenever I hear the name of a foreign country&#44; my heart rushes to there; likewise&#44; whenever I happen to see a foreigner&#44; my mind sketches the picture of a hut surrounded by river&#44; mountain and forest and a free and delightful way of life comes into my mind.1528_277 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Most of the stories of the &#39;Golpoguchha&#39;&#44; a compilation of stories&#44; was written during the phase of &#39;Sabuj Patra&#39; of Rabindranath (1914-17; according to the name of Pramatha Chowdhury edited magazine).1528_282 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	A painting by Asit Kumar Haldar for the first poem &quot;The Beginning&quot;

(The Story of a Muslim Lady/Woman).1528_301 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	On the other hand&#44; by sketching the character of a highly ambitious youth who craves for literary fame&#44; in his story &#39;Darpaharan&#39;

this novel was the disclosure of Rabindranaths conflicted sentiments.1528_312 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	A psychological depression of 1914 was the basis of this novel.1528_313 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The novel ends by wounding Nikhil in a Hindu-Muslim riot.1528_314 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In a similar manner&#44; the debated questions concerning the issue of being an Indian were raised in the novel Gora.1528_315 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	However&#44; racial identity&#44; individual freedom and religious issues were deliberated in the novel Ghare-Baire in the form of a family story and of triangular love.1528_316 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In the novel Yogayog&#44;

proud and a strong believer in male chauvinism.1528_318 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In this novel Rabindranath has highlighted his feminist side.1528_319 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	By using a number of pathos he shows how a Bengali woman&#39;s dilemma and fate control her state of gestation&#44; responsibility and family honor.1528_333 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In a function&#44; the eminent actor Soumitro Chattopadhyay is reciting a poem of Rabindranath; Soumitro has acted in many films based on the novels and stories of Rabindranath.1528_335 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	Apart from being an author of stories&#44;Rabindranath has a special identity as a prose writer.1528_336 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	He has written numerous prose and essays starting from the age of fifteen till the last year of his life.1528_337 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	These are based on literary criticism&#44;

he accepted liberal and universal humanitarianism as the standard in all matters of politics&#44; religion&#44; philosophy&#44; education etc. in his collection of essays &#39;Atmoshakti&#39; (1905)&#44; &#39;Bharatbarsho&#39; (1906)&#44; &#39;Kalantar&#39; (1907)&#44; &#39;Raja Praja&#39; (1908)&#44; &#39;Swadesh&#39; (1908)&#44; &#39;Somaj&#39; (1908)&#44; &#39;Dharmo&#39; (1909)&#44; &#39;Manusher Dharmo&#39;

&#39;Jiban Smriti&#39; (1912)&#44; &#39;Lipika&#39; (1922) etc. are significant not in respect of their subject of discussion rather in their deep sense of emotion.1528_342 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Establishing relationship with various parts of the world was an integral part of self realization for Rabindranath.1528_343 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	These travel stories are written in books like &#39;Europe Pabair Patra&#39; (1881)&#44; &#39;Europe Jatrir Diary&#39; (192-93)&#44; &#39;Japan Jatri Russiar Chithi (1913)&#44; &#39;Parasye&#39;(1936).1528_344 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Moreover&#44; a wonderful documented evidence of his heartfelt emotions and intimacy is his letter-literature: &#39;Chhinnapatra&#39;&#44; &#39;Bhanusingher Patrabali&#39;&#44; &#39;Pathe Prante&#39; and his letters published in nineteen volumes.1528_347 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	At the age of sixteen&#44; Rabindranath enters the field of theater by acting in the lead role of this drama.1528_348 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	At the age of 20 he wrote his first lyrical play &#39;Valmiki Prativa&#39; (The Intelligence of Valmiki).1528_349 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This lyrical play&#44; based on the epic Ramayana as written by Krittibas Ojha&#44; had its central theme the story of how the dacoit Ratnakar had transformed into a great poet Valmiki with mercy of the Goddess Saraswati (the Goddess of knowledge and education according to the Hindu mythology).1528_350 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Through it&#44; Tagore vigorously explores a wide range of dramatic styles and emotions1528_351 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	As he had applied a modern form of Kirtan (a form of devotional songs with music) in the songs&#44; likewise he had used the form of traditional music of British and Irish folk songs to produce evil-songs.1528_352 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	He depicted&#44; in another of his noteworthy play &#39;Dakghar&#39;&#44; how a child ultimately went to sleep with his intent desire for freedom from confinement (probably it was a metaphor of death).1528_353 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	This play became popular all over the world.1528_354 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The play was highly praised in Europe.1528_355 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	According to Rabindranath&#44; the death in this drama is &quot;&quot;spiritual freedom&quot; from &quot;the world of hoarded wealth and certified creeds&quot;.1528_356 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Polish doctor and educator Janusz Korczak choose &quot;The Post Office&quot;&#44; the translated version of Dak Ghar as the play to perform by the orphans who were in his care in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II.1528_357 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	This drama was performed on 18 July&#44; 1942.1528_359 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Betty Jean Lifton&#44; the biographer of Dr. Korczak in her book &#39;The King of Children&#39; wrote that Dr. Korczak actually took up that plan to familiarize those orphan children with death.1528_360 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	He had created a new style of play by making poetry and prosody the central theme of it which was not found in the Bengali dramas before that.1528_361 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Rabindranath himself stated these to be dramas of emotion rather than of action.1528_362 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The drama &#39;Bisarjan&#39; written in 1890 was one of his best dramatic achievements.1528_363 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The characteristics of this play was a complex network of the story and detailed speeches to ones own self.1528_364 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Later on&#44; his plays were being written on the basis of philosophical and morphological dramatic objects.1528_365 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	&#39;Dakghar&#39; (The Post Office) was of this category.1528_366 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Again&#44; in &#39;Chandalika&#39; (a girl of a lowest class of the society)&#44; based on an ancient Buddhist anecdote&#44; Rabindranath shows how Ananda&#44; the disciple of Lord Goutam Buddha&#44; had accepted water from an untouchable tribal woman.1528_367 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In his play &#39;Raktakarabi&#39; (The Red Oleander)&#44; he sketches how a king being inebriated only to make himself more and more opulent&#44; compels his people to work in the mines.1528_368 	A3BNFNWQX37CQV 	the lead of this play a girl named nandini united the people against the exploitations1528_369 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The other remarkable plays of Rabindranath were: &#39;Chitrangada&#39;&#44; &#39;Raja&#39; (The King)&#44; &#39;Mayar Khela&#39; (The Game of Illusion)&#44; &#39;Muktadhara&#39; (The Free Stream)&#44; &#39;Achalayatan&#39; (The Deadlock)&#44; &#39;Sarodotsab&#39; (The festival of the month of Autumn in Bengal)&#44;

is an indispensible part of Bengali culture.1528_379 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Rabindranath&#39;s songs are intimately connected with his literature also - many of his poems are converted into poems &#44; similarly his novels&#44; stories or dramas also have important roles  in his songs.1528_380 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The source of his songs is mainly from Thumri style of Hindustani classical music.1528_381 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	From his early creation of sad Brahma religious songs to pseudo-libidinous light music-- Rabindranath has embodied every forms of human instinct in his musical compositions.1528_382 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	These songs reflected the beauty of different classical Raga (melodic modes used in Indian classical music).1528_383 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Sometimes the rytham and the music of a particular Raga has been followed religeously.1528_384 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	And sometimes to brighten the creativity of his work he has used more than one Raga1528_401 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	A pastel color picture of a Malagan mask of Northern New Zealand: Rabindranath in this picture is an amateur cultivator of primordial tenets.1528_406 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	&quot;Dancing Girl&quot;

slowly with time it turned out to be his passion.1528_410 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	The paintings of Rabindrawnath can be categorized into several groups.1528_411 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Firsly&#44; the painting of face or the facial region&#44; secondly paintings of unique imaginary animals and thirdly the paintings of nature.1528_412 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	There are a few paintings which are out of these categories but most of his paintings comes under any of the three categories mentioned earlier.1528_413 	A1D39ISETGHJB 	Rabindrawnath painted a number of self portraits&#44; too.1528_414 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	He has even painted &quot;Female Nudes&quot; as well.1528_415 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	He had special affinity towards drawing of faces.1528_417 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Rabindranath had a unique style of painting; there was no definite size of the paper neither there was definite use of color1528_418 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Many of the pictures have been damaged beyond restoration as the drawing materials were not of good quality.1528_419 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	He painted pictures with pen&#44; pencil&#44; brush even using his overcoat sleeves as brush to apply color.1528_420 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Using all these ways he painted more than two thousand five hundred pictures.1528_421 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	He had lack of self-confidence: as a result&#44; he was more concern of whether the painting was becoming at all a picture or not than creating a great picture: Rabindranath had said to watch if &quot;the picture becomes a picture&quot;.1528_422 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Inspired by the enthusiasm of a group of artist from South France he first arranged an exhibition of his paintings.1528_423 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	After that his paintings were being exhibited successfully all over Europe.1528_424 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Ever since the first exhibition of his paintings in Pigalle Art Gallery in Paris in 1926&#44; Rabindranath&#39;s paintings are objects of discussion and criticism.1528_438 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Rabindranath hosts Gandhi and wife Kasturba at Santiniketan in 19401528_439 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The political thinking of Rabindranath was quite complex.1528_440 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	He opposed the imperialism and supported the nationalism of India.1528_442 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Evidence produced during the Hindu-German Conspiracy trial and later accounts affirm his awareness of the Ghadarite conspiracy&#44; and stated that he sought the support of Japanese Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake and former Premier kuma Shigenobu.1528_443 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	On the other hand&#44; he had scoffed at the &#39;Swadeshi Movement&#39; with severely harsh words in one of his articles by saying this movement as &quot;Charka-Samskriti&quot; (culture of cutting threads with wheels) in 1925.1528_444 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	British imperialism was a &quot;political symptom of our social disease&quot; from his point of view.1528_445 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	For that&#44; as an alternative he gave importance to self dependence and improved education of a large number people.1528_446 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	And he urged Indians to accept that &quot;there can be no question of blind revolution&#44; but of steady and purposeful education&quot;.1528_449 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Jallianwala Bagh Massacre memorial: Rabindranath renounced his knighthood in protest against the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.1528_450 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	This kind of view point made many people unhappy.1528_451 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Towards the end of 1919&#44; while he was staying in a hotel in San Francisco one extremist organization from India conspired to kill Rabindranath.1528_452 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	But their plan was in vain due to the dissension among them.1528_453 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Rabindranath&#39;s  songs and poems played a  very important role in the freedom fighting movement of India1528_454 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He returned his knighthood in protest against the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in 1919.1528_456 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The song &quot;Ekla Chalo Re was one of Gandhi&#39;s Favorite.1528_457 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The relationship between Rabindranath and Gandhi was very tumultuous.1528_458 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Rabindranath played an important role in solving the difference of opinion between Gandhiji and Ambedkar regarding the separate election system for the Untouchable.1528_459 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	As a result Gandhiji had withdrawn his Fast &#39;until death&#39;.1528_460 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The life of a cage bird is the theme of Rabindranath&#39;s story &#39;Tota Kahini&#39;

California on October 11&#44; 1971 planned for an entirely new type of university as a result of these thoughts.1528_465 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	He expressed his wish to make his Ashram at Shantiniketan an universal centre of education to tie India with the whole world with a single thread reaching beyond the geographical and country limits.1528_466 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The foundation stone of his school&#44;

dominance&#44; religious-blindness&#44;superstition.1529_291 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In this regard Kamal Pasha was the hero of his life.1529_292 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Nazrul also tried to play that type of role in his rebellious life.1529_293 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Notably&#44; in September&#44; 1921&#44; the first socialist party in India was established at the house in Taratala Lane where Muzaffar Ahmed and Nazrul lived.1529_294 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Nazrul was also influenced by the Russian socialist Revolution of 1917.1529_295 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	But he never became a member of this party&#44; though comrade Muzaffar had bee his close friend throughout his life.1529_296 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	He tried to take part in the national election of 1920.1529_297 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	At first he went to Calcutta to get the support of the Congress Party.1529_298 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	But since he did not get any support from Congress&#44; he decided to take part in election all in his own.1529_299 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He did not have much success at the election.1529_300 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	After that his active participation in the politics were reduced though his political thoughts had an outlet through his literature.1529_303 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Kazi Nazrul Islam has been given the honor of the National Poet of Bangladesh.1529_304 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	A government educational institute known as Kazi Nazrul Islam University was established in 2005 in Nazrul&#39;s memory enriched Tirshal (Mymensingh district of Bangladesh).1529_305 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Nazrul Academy was established at Churulia&#44; the birth place of the poet&#44; in West Bangal&#44; Nazrul Academy was also established in the capital city of Dhaka in Bangladesh in memory of the poet; apart from these Bulbul Lalitkala (fine arts) Academy and Bangladesh Nazrul Sena (soldiers) are also established in Bangladesh.1529_306 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In Calcutta&#44;

so the x of cartesian coordinate = Re (z)is x axis and in the same way y=im(z) is y axis.2099_107 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	If a complex number is expressed in Cartesian type then the number is called its Cartesian form or rectangular form ar algebraic form.2099_108 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Absolute value&#44;

subtraction and conjugating operations follow the general geometric explainations.2099_133 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	X = A + B: The sum of two points A and B of the complex plane is the point X = A + B such that the triangles with vertices 0&#44; A&#44; B&#44; and X&#44; B&#44; A&#44; are congruent.2099_134 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	X = AB: The product of two points A and B is the point X = AB such that the triangles with vertices 0&#44; 1&#44; A&#44;

X&#44; are mirror images of each other.2099_136 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	With the help of these geometric interpretations the geometric problems are transformed into algebraic (here the term algebra is a little different from the common algebra) problems and in the same way the algebraic problems can be considered as geometric problems and can be solved.2099_138 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Where the solutions of the equation represent the points on sides of those 17 sided polygon.2099_140 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Cartesian representation of z = x + jy is also expressed through the Polar form.2099_141 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The two accompanying polar co-ordinates of z are r=|2099_143 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Greater than equal to 0 which is called the extreme value or modulus and  = arg(z) which is called the argument of z or angle&#44;

+n)2099_155 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Where for the negative value of Y theta is also negative.2099_156 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	If only positive numbers are required only in the range(0&#44; 2n)2099_157 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Then we have to add the value of theta we got from the formula with 2n.2099_158 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Notation in Polar Form2099_159 	AZVAVU4OYMG2A 	this is expressed generally as polar form.2099_161 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	This is known as trigonometric form &#44; sometimes cis  means cos + i sin &#44; and then it is written as z = r cis2099_163 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Which is called exponential form.2099_164 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	To find out the multiplication&#44; division&#44; index and roots  in the polar form2099_165 	A3BNFNWQX37CQV 	these operations are easier in polar form than cartesian form2099_166 	A3BNFNWQX37CQV 	this can be done by using trignomatry2099_168 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	For the power of the whole number we get according to the Moyver&#39;s theorem&#44;2099_169 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	From there we can get&#44;2099_170 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	The addition of two complex number is like the addition of two vectors in the vector space.2099_171 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	And the product of the two complex numbers can be considered as a rotation or spin applied simultaneously and like the stretching and expansion.2099_172 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Multiplication with i can be shown as the 90 degree(n/2 radian )anti clockwise rotation.2099_173 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Hence from geometric point of view&#44; the equation i2 = -1 means two 90 degree rotation or one 180 degree rotation. Thus (-1).2099_175 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	If c is a complex number and n is positive numerical number&#44; and if any complex number z can satisfy this equation zn=c&#44; then z can be called as the nth value of c.2099_176 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	If c is non-zero then it will have exactly  n numbers of different nth roots.2099_177 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	This n-th order roots can be obtained if we write c as where r &gt; 0 and  is a real number&#44; then the set of the roots of c of the n-th order2099_178 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Where a real number r is a nth positive number.2099_179 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	If C=0&#44; then nth root will be only zero.2099_180 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Where&#44; as the nth root n is condsidered  the multiplicity of this 02099_181 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	The ideas regarding complex numbers are not clear and are not transparent2099_182 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	How much is the complex number complex/real/unreal/imaginary?2099_183 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The set of complex numbers can be defined this way.2099_184 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	Here&#44; we can easily see when b=0.2099_185 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Historically we can see that the theory of the complex numbers has been developed much later than the real numbers.2099_187 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Where a particular result is taken as this.2099_188 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	This is our known imaginary unit with the help of which mathematical theories get promoted to the set of complex numbers from the set of real numbers.2099_189 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Beginning of the non-transparency2099_190 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	First introduction of opacity regarding complex number was from its name.2099_191 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The terminology of this number is complex or imaginary in almost all languages.2099_192 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	It is quite natural that students become suspicious just from the nomenclature itself.2099_193 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	A student becomes familiar with positive real numbers when he learns addition or subtraction for the first time.2099_194 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	He knows by then that it&#39;s not possible to subtract smaller numbers from bigger numbers.2099_195 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	As an example&#44; she is shown the number of balls in a bag or the number of bananas in a bunch of bananas.2099_196 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	After this when he learns arithmatic he gets familiar with fractional numbers.2099_197 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Then he can imagine the fractional numbers with the examples of crossed distance or with other examples.2099_199 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	After that he is introduced with negetive numbers when he begins to learn Algebra.2099_200 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	At the first time he sees this number in a suspiscous way.2099_201 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Because&#44; it is not easy to create a real example of this number.2099_202 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Then after a period of time he may begin to realize it from the conception of debt2099_203 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Like&#44; if someone wants 5 rupees from me and if at that time I don&#39;t have 5 rupees then at that time I am the owner of -5 rupees.2099_204 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	But later while learning higher mathematics when he met with complex number then it becomes difficult for him to find out such types of practical examples.2099_205 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Even if some examples of polynomial root are given still they are not quite satisfactory.2099_206 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Moreover&#44; the name of the number is Complex number&#44; which has a imaginary or non-real part.2099_207 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	For this illusive information comes from its nomenclature&#44; it is getting difficult for him to form an image of this complex number (for most of the time it is impossible).2099_208 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Then what is complex number?2099_209 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Actually all the numbers are only imaginary!2099_212 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	We have imagined these numbers to solve different problems in our real life.2099_213 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	And we have also assured within ourselves through observations that in ideal cases the mathematical solutions work to solve applied problems of our lives as well.2099_214 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In this respect it can be presumed that all varieties of mathematics began with some assumptions.2099_215 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	We accept these postulates with out any proof (in fact they can not be proved).2099_216 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Only from this observation that they are effective in solving real life problems and are not contradictory.2099_217 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Generally we use algebra to solve the real number problem in the real world.2099_218 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Likewise&#44; we use complex numbers in thousands of fields like quantum mechanics&#44; quantum physics (these two are related but different subjects)&#44; quantum electro-dynamics and in many other higher mathematics and science issues.2099_219 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Where mathematical equations or numbers signify different events&#44; quantities and numbers of real life.2099_220 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Actually&#44; at the early stage of learning algebra&#44; a student asks &#39;what is the real meaning of this equation&#39;?2099_221 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	What is the purpose of adding a to b?2099_222 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Can &#39;a&#39; or &#39;b&#39; be any number?&quot;2099_224 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	This is the primary hurdle in learning complex numbers.2099_225 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Therefore complex numbers are only as much complex or imaginary as any other real numbers.2099_226 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	So&#44; by avoiding the literal meaning of the terms of complex numbers&#44; imaginary part etc. the correct picture of complex numbers that we get is like this.2099_227 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	Complex numbers are another kind of numbers that are like the other numbers&#44; but their calculation rules are a bit different.2099_228 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Complex numbers are indispensible for solving many important and real problems.2099_229 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	Meaning&#44; complex numbers are not unreal numbers.2099_231 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	A common misconception2099_232 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	When we consider  an imaginary unit for the complex numbers&#44;   we can easily arrive at an equation.2099_233 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	This equation is another reason why complex number may seem complex or unreal to students.2099_234 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	But the explanation of this is2099_236 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	So the equation is incorrect.2099_237 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	To avoid this mistake the method proposed by Gaus is2099_238 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	If a negative sign comes under a square root then this negative sign must be written in some form so that this sign will not come in next operation.2099_240 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	The words &quot;real&quot; and &quot;imaginary&quot; were significant when complex numbers were only used as a supporting idea related to real numbers.2099_241 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Where only the &quot;real part&quot; would represent the &quot;real world&quot; in the literary sense.2099_242 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Afterwards&#44; especially after the invention of quantum mechanics&#44; it was observed that nature has no additional affinity towards the real numbers.2099_243 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	On the contrary&#44; many &quot;real&quot; incidents require complex numbers in order to be represented mathematically.2099_244 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	As a result&#44; that &quot;imaginary part&quot; of the complex number appears like a &quot;real part&quot; with physical realities.2099_246 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In Control theory physical systems are frequently taken from time domain to frequency domain through Laplace transform.2099_248 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	A complex plane is used in analytical systems like root locus&#44; Nyquist plot and Nicol plot etc.2099_249 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	For example&#44; it is highly important in the Root Locus system whether the poles and the zeros are located at the left half-plane or at the right half-plane on the complex plane (that is&#44; whether the real part of the root is greater or smaller than zero).2099_250 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	If all the poles of a system&#44;2099_251 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	are on the right half plane&#44; then it is unstable2099_252 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	if they are at the left half-plane&#44; then it is stable2099_253 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	if they remain on the axis at the middle&#44; then it is marginally stable.2099_254 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	If there is a zero in the right side of the system then that system is called non minimum phase system.2099_255 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Signal analysis2099_256 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Complex number are used in mathematical representation of periodically changing signals in signal analysis and in some other areas.2099_257 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	A real function expressed in terms of sine and cosine when represented through a complex function&#44;

and she also helped her husband to compose his film songs2459_103 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Though he earned a little but Satyajit considered himself to be rich as he never had to struggle to purchase his favourite books or music albums.2459_104 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	From Devi to Charulata (1959-64)2459_107 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Reversal of the gaze&#44;

but a man.2459_111 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	After his film &#39;Apur Sangsar&#39; (the family of Apu)&#44; he started to work with his next film &#39;Debi&#39;.2459_112 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The theme of this movie was the different deep-rooted prejudices of the Hindu societies.2459_113 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee&#44; a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law2459_114 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Sharmila afterwards commented about her acting in this film that she did nothing from her own in Devi&#44; rather a genius made her act.2459_116 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In 1961&#44; on the insistence of Prime-minister Jawaharlal Nehru&#44; Ray was commissioned to make a documentary on Rabindranath Tagore&#44; on the occasion of the poet&#39;s birth centennial.2459_117 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Due to limited real footage of Tagore available&#44; Ray faced the challenge of making a film out of mainly static material&#44; and he remarked that it took as much work as three feature films.2459_118 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In the same year&#44; together with Subhas Mukhopadhyay and others&#44; Satyajit was able to revive Sandesh&#44; the children&#39;s magazine his grandfather once published.2459_119 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit had been saving money for some years now to make this possible2459_120 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	The magazine was educational as well as entertaining and the name &quot;Sandesh&quot; (this word has two meanings - news and one type of confectionary) reflects dual purpose.2459_121 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit soon found himself illustrating the magazine&#44; and writing stories and essays for children2459_122 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Writing became his major source of income in the years to come.2459_123 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	In 1962&#44; Satyajit directed the film &#39;Kanchanjangha&#39;.2459_124 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	It was his first original screenplay and colour film.2459_125 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The film tells the story of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling&#44; a picturesque hill town in West Bengal&#44; where the family members became rebel against the family leader Indranath Ray.2459_126 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The film was first planned to take place in a large mansion&#44; but Satyajit later decided to film it in the famous hill town where the many shades of light and mist can be use to reflect the tension in the drama.2459_128 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	Satyajit selected Chhobi Biswas to play the role of Indranath Ray in this movie.2459_129 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	This was the last film done by Chhobi Biswas&#44; a few days later he died in a road accident.2459_130 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	As a result Satyajit faced difficulty in some of his future casting of characters&#44; as he felt Chhobi Biswas was the only capable actor to do those roles.2459_131 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	At that time&#44; Satyajit became an internationally renowned film personality and in various film festivals acted as a jury&#44; but he always complained that he never felt creative outside Kolkata.2459_132 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	In 1963&#44; he acted as a jury in Moscow Film Festival&#44; 81/2 by Federico Fellini won the best film award.2459_133 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	In 60s&#44; during his visit to Japan&#44; he met the distiguished film director Akira Kurosawa.2459_134 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	During his stay in the country he used to take breaks from his busy schedule to wrtite scripts in the quiet of Darjiling or Puri.2459_135 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	In 1964&#44; Satyajit made the film Charulata&#44; which was the last film of that phase of his working life&#44; and according to many critics&#44; that was his most successful film he made.2459_136 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	Based on Nashtoneer&#44; a small story written by Rabindranath Tagore&#44;the film tells the story of a 19th century Bengali housewife&#44; Charu&#44;and her feelings towards her brother in law&#44; Amal.2459_137 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	This film is often termed as flawless.2459_138 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit himself famously said the film contained least flaws among his work&#44; and his only work&#44; that given a chance&#44; he would make exactly the same way2459_140 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Two scenes from the film drew the attention of the critics.2459_141 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The first one is the silent seven minutes at the beginning which reflects the monotony of Charu&#39;s life and the second one is the &quot;Swinging in a cradle in the garden&quot; where Charu realised her love for Amal.2459_142 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	During this period the other films by Satyajit were Mahanagar (Megacity)&#44; Teen Kanya (Three Girls)&#44; Avijan (Adventure) and Kapurush (Coward) and Mahapurush (Great Man).2459_143 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	New Horizons (1965-1982)2459_144 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He was known as Manik to people close to him.2459_145 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He interacted with common people much more than his contemporaneous film makers.2459_146 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He used to meet with strangers.2459_147 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	But many of the people who met him used to feel a distance between Satyajit and themselves.2459_148 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Bengalis would consider this to be the reflection of his English mentality and the Westerns would consider that his cool and solemn character was the like those of the Brahmanas.2459_149 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	He kept intense faith on his actors&#44; but sometimes would show his displeasure as well when they were not up to the mark.2459_150 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Not much light was shed on his private life in the newspapers&#44; but according to some people he had a relationship with Madhabi Mukhopadhayay in the sixty&#39;s decade.2459_152 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In this period he experimented liberally in his films and tried to include in his films the various dimensions of the lives of contemporary Indian people.2459_153 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	His first major film of this period was Nayak (The Hero)&#44; where a film star was traveling in a train and he meets a young sympathetic female journalist.2459_154 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Uttam Kumar and Sharmila Tagore starred in this film; it was about exploring the inner conflicts of the apparently highly successful film star in 24 hours of the train journey.2459_155 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Though the movie won the critics award in Barlin&#44; there were not much further reaction on this movie.2459_156 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In 1967 Satyajit wrote script for a film &#39;The Alien&#39;.2459_157 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Columbia Pictures was the producer of this U.S.-India co-production&#44;Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando were selected as the lead actors.2459_158 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But after writing the scripts&#44; Satyajit came to know that he does not have the copyright and will not get any fees for that.2459_159 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Marlon Brando later dropped the project.2459_160 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	An attempt was made to replace him with James Coburn but by that time Satyajit lost hope and returned to Kolkata.2459_161 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Later in 1970 and 1980&#44; Columbia tried to revive the project many times but failed.2459_162 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In 1982 when ET(The Extra Terrestrial) was released many people found the script of the cinema to be similar to the one written by Satyajit.2459_164 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Satyajit believed that Spielberg&#39;s film would not have been possible without his script of The Alien being available throughout America in mimeographed copies.2459_165 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Satyajits son complained that&#44; he always made serious films for mature people.2459_166 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In reply to this and in search of something new&#44; Satyajit made his most commercially successful movie Gupi Gayen Bagha Bayen in 1968.2459_167 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	It was a musical fairy tale based on a children&#39;s story written by his grandfather&#44; Upendrokishore Ray.2459_168 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Goopy the singer and Bagha the drummer&#44; equipped by three boons allowed by the King of Ghosts&#44; set out on a fantastic journey in which they try to stop an impending war between two neighbouring kingdoms.2459_169 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Among his most expensive enterprises&#44; it turned out to be very hard to finance; Satyajit abandoned his desire to shoot it in colour2459_170 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	turning down an offer that would have forced him to cast a certain Bollywood actor as the lead.2459_171 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Thereafter&#44; Satyajit produced the film &#39;Aranyer Din Ratri&#39; based on a novel written by Sunil Gangopadhyay&#44; a young poet and writer.2459_172 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Featuring a musical structure acclaimed as even more complex than Charulata2459_173 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The film traces four urban young men going to the forests for a vacation&#44; trying to leave their petty urban existence behind2459_174 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Robin Wood opined that from only one shot [of the film] it is possible to gather sufficient material to write a short story.2459_176 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	His film  Aranyer Din-Ratri was very famous.And after this film he concentrated  on the basic problem of Bengalo community .2459_177 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	It is often said about Satyajit that he was indifferent to the contemporary Indian urban experiences.2459_178 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In reply he made three films based on Kolkata which are also known as &#39;Kolkata trilogy&#39;: &#39;Protidwandi&#39;(1970)&#44; &#39;Simabaddha&#39;(1971) and &#39;Janaranya&#39;(1975).2459_179 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Though these three films were planned separately&#44; due to similarity in the subject these are considered as a weak  trilogy.2459_180 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	The hero of Protibondi is an eminent youngster who though was a very good person but at the end of the film he too got involved in corruption.2459_181 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The hero of Jana Aranya was another young graduate&#44; who surrenders himself to corruption to make a living.2459_182 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	And the hero of Seemabaddha who was a successful man&#44; gave up his morals for more gains.2459_183 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Out of that in the film Pratidwandi&#44; Satyajit uses an elliptical narrative style with the help of negative style&#44; dream sequences and abrupt flashbacks were taken.2459_184 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Apart from that in 1970&#44; Satyajit made two films Sonar Kella and Joy Baba Felunath based on the hero of his own written popular detective series&#44; Feluda.2459_185 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Satyajit thought to make a film on the Bangladesh Liberation War but later he abandoned the idea saying that as a filmmaker he was more interested in the travails and journeys of the refugees and not politics.2459_186 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In 1977 Satyajit made an Urdu film &#39;Satranj Ki Khiladi&#39;.2459_188 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	A commentary on the circumstances that led to the colonization of India by the British was depicted in this film2459_189 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This was the only film of Satyajit Ray made in different language from Bengali.2459_190 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	This is also his most expensive and star-studded film&#44; featuring likes of Sanjeev Kumar&#44; Saeed Jaffrey&#44; Amjad Khan&#44; Shabana Azmi&#44; Victor Bannerjee and Richard Attenborough2459_191 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Later on Satyajit made a film of one hour duration called &#39;Sadgati&#39; in Hindi based on Prechand&#39;s story.2459_192 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In this movie&#44; the pathetic reality of untouchables existing in India was shown.2459_193 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In 1980 Satyajit produced &#39;Hirak Rajar Deshe&#39;&#44; the successor of &#39;Gupi Gain Bagha Bain&#39; which reflected his political opinion.2459_194 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The character of &quot;Hirok Raja&quot; was the reflection of Indian government during Indira Gandhi&#39;s emergency period.2459_195 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	This phase of Satyajit&#39;s life ended through the production of a highly praised&#44; short duration film &#39;Piku&#39;2459_196 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The Last Phase (1983-1992)2459_198 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In 1987&#44; he made a documentary on his father&#44; Sukumar Ray.2459_199 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In 1983&#44; while working on Ghare Baire (Home and the World)&#44; Satyajit suffered a heart attack that would severely limit his output in the remaining 9 years of his life2459_201 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	His son would operate the camera from then on2459_202 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Satyajit had an intention for a long time of making a film with this novel of Rabindranath based on blind nationalism and he had even written a script for the film during 1940s.2459_203 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In spite of rough patches due to his illness&#44; the film did receive some critical acclaim&#44; and it contained the first full-blown kiss in Ray&#39;s films. In 19872459_204 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In 1987 Satyajit made a documentary on his father Sukumar Roy.2459_205 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	His last three films were made in an indoor studio because of his health condition.2459_206 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	These film were quite different from his earlier film and they were mainly dialogue based films.2459_207 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	His direction was comparatively weak in his film &#39;Ganashatru&#39; (The Enemy of the People) in 1989 and this film has been considered as his trial of making films after recovering from long illness.2459_208 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film Shakha Proshakha2459_209 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In this film&#44; an old man who lived his whole life in honesty&#44; comes to know about the corruption of his three sons; in the last scene he finds solace in the companionship of his mentally ill but uncorrupted fourth son.2459_210 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit&#39;s swan song Agantuk (The Stranger) is lighter in mood.2459_211 	A3BNFNWQX37CQV 	in this movie a person meets a family and introduces himself as their uncle whom they lost years ago.2459_213 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In 1992&#44; Satyajit was admitted to a hospital with heart complications&#44; and would never recover.2459_214 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	An honorary Oscar was awarded to him weeks before his death&#44; which he received in a gravely ill condition2459_215 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	He died on 23 April 1992.2459_217 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit Ray considered script-writing to be an integral part of direction2459_218 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	For this reason&#44; at the primary stage if work life&#44; he was not interested in making film in any language other than Bengali.2459_219 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He wrote scripts in English for his two non-Bengali feature films which were translated by the translators in Hindi and Urdu under his supervision.2459_220 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Satyajit and his Art Director&#44; Bangshi Chandragupta thought that existence of the stage of cinema depends on the script.2459_221 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit would always write scripts in English before creating a Bengali version&#44; so that the non-Bengali Chandragupta would be able to read it2459_222 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Camera work in Ray&#39;s early films  garnered high regard for the craft of Subrata Mitra who bitterly left the Ray&#39;s crew afterwards.2459_223 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	According to a number of critics&#44; his departure lowered the quality of cinematography in his films.2459_225 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Pioneering works of Subrata Mitra included development of &quot;bounce lighting&quot;&#44; a technique of bouncing light off cloth to create a diffused realistic light even on a set2459_226 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Apart from that Satyajit admitted the influence of French New Wave directors&#44; Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut on his new technical and cinematic innovations.2459_227 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Satyjit&#39;s films were edited regularly by Dulal Dutta though  Satyajit himself most of the time gave instructions to Dulal in this respect.2459_228 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In fact&#44; because of financial reasons and Ray&#39;s meticulous planning&#44; his films were mostly cut &quot;on the camera&quot; (apart from Pather Panchali).2459_229 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	At the beginning of his career&#44; Satyajit got a chance to work with some talented Indian classical musicians such as Ravi Shankar&#44; Vilayat Khan and Ali Akbar Khan.2459_230 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But his experience was painful.2459_231 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	He realized the singers were much more concerned with their songs than his films.2459_232 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Satyajit would prefer to use the western classical music&#44; especially for those of his films made in the background of cities.2459_233 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	For this reason he started to compose his own music from his film &#39;Tin Kanya&#39; (The Three Women).2459_234 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The work of actors was also widely praised in Satyajits films.2459_235 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Famous film stars as well as people who have never seen a film (such as in Aparajito) worked in Satyajit&#39;s film.2459_237 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The nature of his direction would depend on the talent and experience of the actors.2459_238 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	He gave no such direction to the actors like Utpal Dutta&#44; on the other hand&#44; he used Subir Bandyopadhyay in the character of Apu and Sharmila Tagore in the character of Aparna like a &quot;doll&quot;.2459_239 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The subjects of Satyajit&#39;s films were multidimensional2459_240 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Regarding this&#44; in 1975 he said that his critics often allege him of showing the tendency of hopping like a grass hopper and that in his films no known trends are observed so that he can be labeled as something specific.2459_241 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	In self defense on this matter he said that this multifaceted nature is the reflection of his own character only&#44; behind his every film there is a well thought decision working.2459_244 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Front page of a collection of short stories by Satyajit.2459_246 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Satyajit was the creator of the two most popular characters in the Bengali literature.2459_247 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	One is the detective Feluda&#44; and the other one is the Scientist Professor Shanku.2459_248 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	He also wrote short stories which were published as volumes of 12 stories&#44; always with names playing on the word twelve (for example Aker pitthe dui&#44; or literally &quot;Two on top of one&quot;).2459_249 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Ray&#39;s interest in puzzles and puns is reflected in his stories&#44;2459_262 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The book is recently published in English in the name of &#39;Speaking of Films&#39;.2459_263 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In addition Satyajit wrote a book of nonsense rhymes &#39;Toray Bandha Ghorar Dim&#39; containing a translation of Lewis Carol&#39;s &#39;Jabberwocky&#39;.2459_264 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	He also authored a collection of humorous stories of Mullah Nasiruddin in Bengali.2459_265 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Satyajit ray designed two typefaces named Ray Roman&#39; and &#39;Ray Bizarre&#39;.2459_266 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Ray Roman won an international competition in 1970.2459_267 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	While in film industry&#44; he continued to be known as an eminent graphic designer.2459_268 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	All of his books and covers are illustrated by him.2459_269 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Besides all the advertisements in his cinemas were also created by he himself.2459_270 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Audience and Critic&#39;s Feedback2459_271 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Ray&#39;s work has been described as reverberating with humanism and universality2459_272 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	His films are of deceptive simplicity with deep underlying complexity2459_274 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Many people have heartily praised his works and the most important of them is this statement of Akira Kurosawa: &quot;Not to have seen the cinemas of Satyajit Ray is same as living in the world without seeing the sun and the moon&quot;.2459_275 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	But his detractors find his films glacially slow&#44; moving like a &quot;majestic snail.&quot;2459_276 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Some find his humanism simple-minded&#44; and his work anti-modern2459_277 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	They also think that unlike his contemporary film directors&#44; new expression or experimentation cannot be seen in Satyajit&#39;s films.2459_278 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	As Stanley Kauffman wrote&#44; some critics believe that Ray &quot;assumes [viewers] can be interested in a film that simply dwells in its characters&#44; rather than one that imposes dramatic patterns on their lives.&quot;2459_279 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit himself commented that this slowness is something he can do nothing about. Kurosawa defended him by saying that Ray&#39;s films were not slow at all&#44;2459_280 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	&quot;On the contrary&#44; they can be compared with a large peacefully flowing river&quot;.2459_282 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	His critics have often compared him with famous personalities of cinema and other mediums like Anton Chekhov&#44; Jean Renoir&#44; Vittorio De Sica&#44; Howard Hawks or Volfgang Amadeus Mozart.2459_283 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	He has been compared with Shakespeare too.2459_285 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	V. S. Naipaul compared a scene of Shatranj Ki Khiladi to a Shakespearian play and said&#44; &quot;Only three hundred words are spoken but goodness!2459_286 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	terrific things happen.&quot; It is generally acknowledged&#44; even by those who were not impressed by the aesthetics of Ray&#39;s films&#44; that he was virtually peerless in that his films encompass a whole culture with all its nuances2459_288 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	&quot;But it is commonly said that the films made after his heart attack were not so lively as those made before.&quot;2459_289 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Early in 1980&#44; Ray was openly criticized by an Indian M.P. and former actress Nargis Dutt&#44; who accused Ray of &quot;exporting poverty&#44;&quot; demanding he make films to represent &quot;Modern India.&quot;[63] On the other hand&#44; a common accusation levelled against him by advocates of socialism across India was that he was not &quot;committed&quot; to the cause of the nation&#39;s downtrodden classes&#44; with some commentators accusing Ray of glorifying poverty in Pather Panchali and Asani Sanket through lyricism and aesthetics2459_290 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	They also accused him of providing no solution to conflicts in the stories&#44; and being unable to overcome his bourgeoisie background2459_291 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	His son Sandip was physically harmed during the Naxalite movements in 1970.2459_292 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In a public debate during the 1960s&#44; Ray and the openly Marxist filmmaker Mrinal Sen engaged in an argument2459_293 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Mrinal Sen criticized Satyajit for casting commercial film star Uttam Kumar in his film.2459_294 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Satyajit replied that Mrinal Sen only knew how to strike on the &quot;soft-targets&quot; (as well as the Bengali middle class).2459_295 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Story of the Legend2459_298 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit with his Academy Award just days before his death.2459_299 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Satyajit Ray is a cultural icon in India and in Bengali communities worldwide2459_300 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Following his death&#44; the city of Kolkata came to a virtual standstill.2459_302 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Satyajit immensely influenced the Bengali cinema world.2459_303 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The cinematic techniques of Satyajit have greatly inspired the Bengali film makers like Aparna Sen&#44; Rituporno Ghosh&#44; Goutam Ghosh and Tareq Masood of Bangladesh.2459_304 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Film makers like Buddhadeb Dasgupta&#44; Mrinal Sen ad Adur Gopalkrishnan acknowledged extraordinary contributions of Satyajit towards Indian cinema.2459_305 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Beyond India&#44; filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese&#44; James Ivory&#44; Abbas Kiarostami&#44; Elia Kazan have been influenced by his cinematic style.2459_306 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Ira Sachs&#39;s 2005 work Forty Shades of Blue was a loose remake of Charulata&#44; and in Gregory Nava&#39;s 1995 film My Family&#44; the final scene is duplicated from the final scene of Apur Sansar2459_307 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Similar references to Ray films are found&#44; for example&#44; in recent works such as Sacred Evil&#44;[76] the Elements trilogy of Deepa Mehta and even in films of Jean-Luc Godard.[2459_308 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon in the American animated television series The Simpsons was named in homage to Ray&#39;s popular character from The Apu Trilogy2459_309 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The photograph of Satyajit with Madhabi Mukherjee is featured on the stamp of Dominica - It was the first for any Indian film personalities.2459_310 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Many literary works include references to Ray or his work.2459_311 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Salman Rushdie&#39;s Haroun and the Sea of Stories contains fish characters named Goopy and Bagha&#44; a tribute to Ray&#39;s fantasy film2459_312 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Many institutions have conferred on Satyajit the Honorary Doctorate degree.2459_314 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	He was awarded the Legion of Honor by the President of France in 1987.2459_315 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	A few days before he died the government of India had presented him the highest civilian honor of India The Bharat Ratna (The Jewel of India).2459_316 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In 1993 Satyajit Ray Film and Study Center was established by the University of California&#44;

is given regularly since the inception of the &#39;London Film Festival&#39;.2459_320 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This award is conferred on those directors who make quality full length films and whose films are akin to that of Satyajit Roy&#39;s in terms of their artistic quality&#44; compassion and humanity.2459_321 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Wes Anderson has claimed that his films are particularly influenced by Satyajit.2459_322 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	He dedicated his recent film The Darjeeling to Satyajit Ray.2459_323 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Awards and Honors2459_324 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Satyajit was awarded with several awards in his lifetime.2459_326 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Charlie Chaplin was the first film personality to get D.

1949 in program called &#39;Third Program&#39; broadcast in BBC Radio&#44; mostly sarcastically&#44; called this theory of  Lematre &#39;Big Bang&#39; which means a &#39;big chaos&#39;.35674_40 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Thereafter in different programs he used that term.35674_41 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Especially&#44;

website does not need to depend on the external formation or structure of the network.73159_11 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Apart from this&#44; the domain names are simpler than the IP addresses.73159_12 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	For example&#44; it is easier to remember &quot;&quot; than remembering an IP address of 208.77.188.166.73159_13 	A1ZAA9FM3OEIK5 	Ordinary people remember URL and e-mail address&#44; but they never think about the way a computer finds them.73159_14 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	In the Domain name system&#44; the job of assigning the domain names and connecting them to the IP addresses is divided between some authoritative Name Servers73159_15 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	A central server is not needed as these servers can separately perform the task of registration and change of domain name.73159_16 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In addition DNS is also used for other services like RFID tag&#44; UPC code&#44; use of international characters in place of internet host name etc.73159_18 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Instead of digital address of the computer&#44;  user friendly names were being used even before TCP/ IP.73159_19 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	During the time of Arpanet also user friendly names were used.73159_20 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	However&#44; a different system was used then.73159_21 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	DNS was invented in 1983 just a few days after TCP/IP.73159_22 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In the old system each computer on the network used to retrieve a file called HOSTS.TXT from SRI (now SRI International).73159_23 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	From this HOSTS.TXT file&#44; mapping of names to numerical addresses was accomplished.73159_24 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Even in the present time there is also a host file in every modern operating system too through which the users can connect the different names (like&#44; www.example.net) with the IP addresses (like&#44; 208.77.188.166) even without the help of DNS.73159_25 	A3BNFNWQX37CQV 	the main problem of this system is that whenever a address changes to an ip address then all the computers that wanted to be connected with this computer have to update this file.73159_26 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	With the expansion of the network such a situation came in need which says that if the address of the host changes then also it will not be required to update every where and updating in only one place is also possible.73159_27 	A3BNFNWQX37CQV 	the other hosts are informed dynamically about this change through notification.73159_28 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In this way a common system will be built up so that all host names can be identified with their connected IP address.73159_30 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The main specification of this can be found in RFC 882 and RFC 883.73159_31 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	On the month of November in the year 1987 RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 were published so that the specification update of DNA can be made.73159_32 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	As a result RFC 882 and 883 was canceled.73159_33 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The different extensions of the present DNS Core are proposed in a number of recent RFC.73159_34 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	In 1984&#44; four Berkeley studentsDouglas Terry&#44; Mark Painter&#44; David Riggle and Songnian Zhouwrote the first UNIX implementation which was later supervised by Ralph Campbel.73159_35 	AKZBNT298EBKI 	In 1985&#44;

Later&#44; a well was dug in the tomb area where water comes.7523_161 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Which has been filled up with stones later on and that was the foundation of the tomb.7523_162 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	In order to measure the layer of water as time passes&#44;another draw well was excavated with similar depth.7523_165 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The platform was so huge that it took around a year to dismantle and remove the platform after the work was over.7523_166 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	According to the legend&#44; Shah Jahan declared that anyone can take the bricks from the scaffold and within a night all bricks were removed by farmers and day labourers.7523_167 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	A fifteen kilometer sloped road was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site.7523_168 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	From a contemporary source it is known that a special type of bullock cart was made which was pulled by 20 to 30 bulls  walking side by side to carry these materials to to the work site.7523_169 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The post and beam pulley system was used to set the blocks into perfect positions.7523_170 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Group of donkeys and oxen used to supply power to pull the rope.7523_171 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Construction work was like this.7523_175 	A2LG0SJYIUIRNC 	Mosque and Temple.7523_177 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	The base and the burial took 12 years to construct.7523_178 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	The rest of the remaining construction work took another 10 years to get completed.7523_179 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	The Historians of that time  have stated different dates of completeion of the entire compound area because the compound area was built in different parts and their completion  date was also not at the same time.7523_180 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	Though the construction work for the tomb was completed during the year 1643&#44;

an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism.7523_185 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Water used to be stored in a big tank and was sent to the supply tank underneath the Taj Mahal.7523_186 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	From the distribution tank&#44; water was supplied to three subsidiary tanks from which it was piped to the complex of Taj Mahal.7523_187 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	A 25 meters long earthen pipe was taken along the main path under the depth of 1.5 meters.7523_188 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Which fills the main tank of the area.7523_190 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	A number of subsidiary channels were also dug to water the entire garden.7523_191 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The fountain pipes were not directly connected to the supply pipes.7523_192 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Instead&#44; a copper container was installed under each of the fountain.7523_193 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The water would fill the containers at first so as to create equal pressure to every fountain.7523_194 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The houses are no more there&#44; but other parts of the structure are still remaining intact.7523_196 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The Tajmahal was not designed by any single particular person.7523_197 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	This type of projects needs many talented people.7523_198 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The names of those who participated in constructing the Taj Mahal was found through different sources.7523_199 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Persian architect&#44; Ustad Isa&#39;s name was found in many places for playing a special role in layout designing.7523_200 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Puru of Benares in Persia (Iran) mentioned him as a supervising architect in a French article (see ISBN 964-7483-39-2).7523_202 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The golden rod on the main dome was designed by Qazim Khan of Lahore.7523_203 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Chiranjilal&#44;

more than 1000 Elephants were used to transport the construction materials.7523_210 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The translucent white marble was brought from Rajasthan; the medium quality red&#44; yellow stone was brought from Punjab.7523_211 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Light hard&#44; white&#44; green stones&#44; quartz etc were brought from China.7523_212 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	The turquoise greenish blue (Firoza) coloured stone was bought from Tibet  and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan.7523_214 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Twenty eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.7523_216 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	It is quite difficult to calculate the construction cost of that time and due to certain complications some differences arise while calculating the actual construction cost of the Tajmahal.7523_217 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	It is estimated that around 32 million rupees was spent at that time to construct Taj Mahal.7523_218 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	But including labor expenses&#44; the time taken to build&#44; and for different economic reasons the value of Taj Mahal in present times is immense&#44; it is called priceless.7523_220 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Soon after the completion of Taj Mahal&#44; Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort.7523_221 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	It is said that he spent the rest of his life constantly looking at the Taj Mahal through the window of the Agra fort7523_222 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	After the death of Sahajahan his son Aurangzeb put his grave in the Taj Mahal beside his wife.7523_223 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Only this incident have destroyed the principle of Taj Mahal.7523_224 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	During the 19th century&#44;

but the then craftsman could not make it correctly) in the stage inside the Taj Mahal.7523_233 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	At that very time the design of the garden round the Taj was changed and made it like that of an English park which is still there.7523_234 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	In the 20th century&#44; Taj Mahal was maintained and protected properly.7523_235 	A3KUMU0O6YW08U 	During the year 1942&#44; at the time of Japaneese and German air attacks&#44; a protective covering was built on top of Taj Mahal.(see the picture)7523_236 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	At the time of India -Pakistan war in 1965 and 1971&#44;

even if the influenza virus infects them&#44; it doesn&#39;t become epidemic.82340_16 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	If a new type of influenza virus originates&#44; then&#44; due to absence of immune defense against it&#44; that certain community gets infected of the influenza virus.82340_17 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	A new strain of influenza virus can be originated in two ways:82340_18 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Antigenic Shift&#44; or82340_19 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Antigenic Drift82340_20 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	As this influenza virus is found in swine&#44; it is called swine flu virus.82340_21 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	As a result&#44; the flu which is caused by this virus is called swine flu.82340_22 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The sign of flu epidemic found in April 2009 is being called swine flu because it originated with the combination of swine&#44; birds and human influenza. As a result human beings are also getting infected by the virus which is found in swine.82340_23 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	As this virus was not there before in the human community  many people died for lack of immunity.82340_25 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	Fifty million people died in Spain in 1918 A.D.due to flu epidemic.That virus was influenza A H1N1.82340_26 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	In the year 1957 2 million people died in Asia due to flu and the virus responsible for it was A H2N2.82340_27 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This type of virus was the outcome of the fusion of human and wild duck&#39;s influenza virus.82340_28 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	The outbreak of 1968&#44;which was detected in Hongkong&#44; H3N2 species was the root of it.About one million people died through out the world due to this.82340_29 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	But due to the combined activities against the flu viruses among the different countries and organizations&#44; people are more conscious about the flu viruses now than the recent past.82340_30 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	How is swine flu spread to the human body82340_31 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	It is thought that this influenza which is made up with the combination of human&#44;bird and swine is spread to humans through swine.82340_32 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The difference between avian and swine flu influenza is that swine flu can transmit human to human.82340_33 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	This was not seen in the case of Avian Influenza.82340_34 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	As the portal of entry into human body for influenza virus is the respiratory tract&#44; naturally Swine Influenza virus also spreads through breathing.82340_35 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	It takes place in the Upper respiratory tract.82340_37 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Not only that this virus can also spread through non - living elements like handkerchiefs&#44;

galaxies and other astronomic bodies are formed.35674_101 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Although this process is not as easy as it seems to be.35674_103 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Then there were three types of matters present in the universe: cold dark matters&#44; hot dark matters and Baryonic matters.35674_104 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	It has been known from the most reliable information as received from an artificial satellite called the WMAP that the amount of cold dark matter is in the highest quantity in the universe&#44; almost 80%.35674_105 	A1JLK9H341BM2K 	The other two type of elements comprises of only 20%.35674_106 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	A mysterious type of power is existing throughout the most of the places of the present universe.35674_107 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The energy which is the most responsible factor for the enormous mass and energy of the universe is called the dark energy.35674_108 	A1JLK9H341BM2K 	In the present universe almost 70% of the total energy is this invisible force.35674_109 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	If the extent of the Universe is defined by means of speed-distance graph then the line of the graph is not rectilinear.35674_110 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	This happens due to some invisible force.35674_111 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	Therefore&#44; because of this energy&#44; when the distance is very large&#44; the velocity of that body increases much more than normal.35674_112 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	That is the more the distance&#44; the more the increase in speed.35674_113 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	Considering a general assumption&#44; the amount of this invisible energy comes as a universal constant in Einstein&#39;s field equation&#44; even though it has not been possible to explore the nature of this energy yet.35674_115 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	All these observations have been included in Lambda-CDM model of cosmology.35674_116 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	This model consists of the extracts of all the models and is basically a mathematical one having six open parameters.35674_117 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	However&#44; a mysterious condition occurs when we look towards the initial stage of creation of the universe.35674_118 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	At that time&#44; the energy of the particles was so large that it is very not possible to perform a realistic experiment in present day perspective.35674_182 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	There are two possible explanations to observe the principles of Hubble-- one is: we are near the center of an explosion in the galaxy.35674_183 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	This observation can not be supported if the theory of Copernican is accepted.35674_184 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The other one is: the universe is expanding in a constant rate on all sides as a well-proportioned property of time and space.35674_185 	A3PSUT241Y12MZ 	This observation was made long before Hubble presented his theory.35674_186 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Then the observation was done on the basis of general theory of relativity.35674_187 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This observation alone is conceded to be the fundamental background of the Theory of Big Bang.35674_188 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	It was proposed by Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker35674_192 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The picture of cosmic microwave background radiation as received from WMAP.35674_193 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The theory of Big Bang had mentioned the phenomenon of cosmic microwave background radiation.35674_194 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	It&#39;s other name is CMB which is built with photons turned out during the first Baryogenesis.35674_195 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	As in the early universe there existed equilibrium of heat&#44; radiation temperature and quantity of plasma were equal before the plasmas got united again.35674_196 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Before the formation of atoms&#44; radiation was alternatively coming out and being absorbed again in a steady way which is called Compton diffusion.35674_197 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Which means that the ancient universe was not transparent to light.35674_198 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	However&#44; as the universe was expanding&#44; at the same time it became cool slowly and at one stage the temperature came down below 3000 Kelvin.35674_199 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	At this point the nucleus and electrons were unified to form an atom.35674_200 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	At the same time the plasmas of the primary age was transformed into an inert gas.35674_201 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	This process is called photon decoupling.35674_202 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	During that period a dormant state was existing in the universe with the combination of impartial atoms and different gaseous matters.35674_204 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	As there existed heat equilibrium in the early universe&#44; the radiation spectrum of that time was similar to that of a black body.35674_205 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Later according to Hubble&#39;s law&#44; temperature started to reduce due to red shifting and omission was seen in the behavior of blackbody.35674_206 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson had discovered the background radiation almost by chance.35674_207 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Then they were measuring the values of different observations made with a microwave transmitting device in a laboratory owned by Bell Laboratories.35674_208 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The radiation they had discovered was isotopic and it consisted of the property of the radiation of the black matters; the temperature of that radiation was almost 3 kelvin.35674_209 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	This discovery became an argument in support of Big Bang theory and secured the Nobel Prize for Penzias and Wilson.35674_210 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	In 1989&#44; NASA sent a satellite named Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE) to explore the background radiation.35674_211 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Data received from this artificial satellite on background radiation supported the concept of Big Bang theory.35674_212 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The residual temperature obtained from COBE was 2.736 Kelvin.35674_213 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	It was also known that CMB is isotropic at the rate of one in one hundred and five.35674_214 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In 2003 through the artificial satellite WMAP better quality pictures could be obtained.35674_216 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	However&#44; its data supported the basic model of cosmic inflation.35674_217 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The abundance of basic elements.35674_218 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	It is possible to measure the ratios of common Hydrogen with Helium-4&#44; Helium-3&#44; Deuterium and with Helium-7 by using the designs of the Big Bang.35674_219 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	The abundance of these elements depends mainly on ratio of photon and barion.35674_220 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The ratios (with regard to mass) that were expected in this model are as follows:35674_221 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	For 4He/H it is approximately 0.2535674_222 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	For 2H/H&#44; it is approximately 10.335674_223 	A6W0G97QVYS6B 	For 3He/H&#44; it is approximately 10.435674_224 	A3BNFNWQX37CQV 	for 7Li/H approximately 10-935674_225 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	These ratios can be predicted with only one number.35674_226 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This number is the ratio between Baryon and Photon.35674_228 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	At all events&#44; this abundance is a clear proof in support of the Big Bang theory; because this abundance can&#39;t be explained by any other theory except the Big Bang.35674_229 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Surprisingly it has been observed that in the early universe either quantity of helium is more than that of deuterium or deuterium is more than helium (He-3) but they always maintain a constant ratio.35674_230 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Evolution and distribution of the galaxies35674_231 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	In fine analysis it is seen that the inner structure of galaxies and quasars and the distribution system of large scale formations support Big Bang theory.35674_232 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	By considering all these types of observations it is known that almost after one billion years of big bang the first galaxy and quasar was formed and from then onwards larger structures like galactic structures and super-structures began to be created.35674_233 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The age of the galaxies are increasing slowly and at the same time several evolutions are taking place in them.35674_296 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But there is no doubt that these are some of the oldest creation in the universe.35674_301 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	A pie chart of proportional composition of different energy-density components of the Universe&#44; according to Lambda CDM design35674_302 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	This was proved by the different experiments during 1970s and 80s that the amount of energy of the gravitational force existing in the galaxies and the spaces between them is apparently so huge that it is impossible for the visible matters to produce such enormous energy.35674_303 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Which means the energy was much more than the existing matters.35674_305 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Before that the thinking was that all matters in the universe are normal which we can see and observe.35674_306 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	But this idea was strongly inconsistent with observations.35674_307 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	If we disregard the dark matters then we would find that at present the amount of Deuterium is much less than they should have been.35674_308 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	There is no other way than to presume the existence of the dark matter to redress the problem.35674_319 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	According to this statistics&#44; the density of the universe is only 30 percent of the density of the Earth.35674_320 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	By the smallest wavelength of the universe it is denoted that the earth is overall a plain.35674_321 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	For this reason&#44; there is no explanation for 70 percent of this energy density.35674_322 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Currently this strange phenomenon points towards another aspect: independent measurements of new born stars like La&#44; it can be established that it is actually taking part in the expansion of the Universe.35674_323 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	To explain this acceleration&#44; the general theory of relativity must be adopted to an universal postulation which assumes the presence of the source of large amount of negative energy.35674_324 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	This leads to the concept of the invisible energy.35674_325 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	It is thought that the remaining 70% of this strength is made by it.35674_327 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	The probable solution of this can be found by taking the scaler quantity of the universal constant and assuming the quantity of the quintessence quantity of the physical zero formation.35674_328 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	However&#44; researches are even now going on to have a further understanding of the subject.35674_352 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Here&#44; the epoch of the expanding universe have been shown as the metric expansion directed in the left35674_353 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Image: WMAP notified&#44; 200635674_354 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Though the Big Bang in the theory  of Universe is considered to be indespensible&#44; it may require revision in future.35674_355 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Our knowledge of the time&#44; which we have presumed to be the starting point of the expansion&#44; is very limited.35674_356 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	There might be something more in the universe beyond that we have so far presented with theoretical axioms.35674_357 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	In the case of expansion&#44; we consider that the exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.35674_358 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	To get an extensive knowledge of what actually had happened at that time is only possible when the theories of the physics will be understandable in the high energy scale.35674_359 	A1JLK9H341BM2K 	Every assumption in this respect is treated as quantum physics35674_360 	A1JLK9H341BM2K 	Some hypothesis are as follows:35674_372 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	This theory does not conform to some religions and to some viewpoints towards the universe.35674_373 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Some information cannot be determined by the scientist with the Big Bang Theory&#44; and some definition needs to be questioned due to the Big Bang theory (first theory).35674_374 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Some naturalistic philosophers comment that these points of view are the modern Puran (an old Indian script) of the creation of the universe.35674_375 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	According to some&#44; the Big Bang theory creates a conflict with traditional viewpoint&#44; as for example&#44; Genesis of Bible gives a different explanation.35674_376 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Hugh Ross&#44; a creationist thinks that the Big Bang theory lends support to the Ex Nihilo theory of creation.35674_377 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Here is a list of explanations given by different religions about the Big Bang theory.35674_379 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Regarding the different theories&#44; many Christians and the traditional Jewish believe that the Big Bang theory could be the possible means of the creation of the universe.35674_380 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	They call it the first philosophical reason.35674_381 	A31II4QBW2DURA 	Pope Pius was a big supporter of the Big Bang theory&#44; though&#44; during that period&#44; this theory was not scientifically fully established.35674_382 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Presently The Roman Catholic Church supports the Big Bang theory and believes that the Big Bang theory is consistent with Genesis of the Bible.35674_384 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Some said that it fits with the description of Kabbalah.35674_385 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	Religion of Islam35674_386 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Modern Islamic scholars say that the view of Quran is completely coherent with the Big Bang theory and a scientific view of it can be found in the Quran.35674_387 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The Ayah related to this subject is (Surah Ambiya; 21:30).35674_388 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Even the eminent Islamic thinkers have reckoned that the issue of an expanding universe has been mentioned in the Quran (Shura Aj-Yariat; 21:47):35674_389 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	The Big Crunch and Oscillatory Universe theory has gained the support of Koran. (Surah Amibya 21: 104):35674_391 	A16IVTYAYSV3SA 	Some theists of the Hindu religion&#44; like Vaishnab religion&#44; supports the theory of the Big Bang.35674_392 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	For example&#44; in the third book of Bhagbat Pruran (Chapter 10&#44;26) a primitive stage has been mentioned which exploded when Vishnu stared on it.35674_393 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Apart from that&#44; there is no start or end of the universe as per the view of another group of Hindus.35674_394 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	There is no starting point in the Buddhist explanation of creation of the universe.35674_396 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Through this theory the Big Bang cannot be protested but can be supported.35674_397 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	The popular Zen culture supports a vibrating universe.35674_399 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	The photographic timeline of the Big Bang35674_400 	A3F9QBUALMKO1 	Timeline of the Big Bang35674_401 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	Cosmic horizon35674_402 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	Metric expansion of the universe35674_404 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	External links and references35674_405 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	General discussion of Big Bang35674_406 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	To view a text-book list on this subject&#44; see: physical world cosmology.35674_408 	APKIU97LIYZ8U 	Helpful research articles35674_414 	A28YA9BQFLXOPT 	Subject: Astronomical Physical Science35674_415 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Subject: Physical laws of the universe82340_100 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	Though there is no report of death82340_101 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	So far 2722 persons have been diagnosed with Swine Flu in India.82340_102 	A2HFASY1SVXPSP 	So far 60 people have died from Swine Flu in India82340_104 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	3.
