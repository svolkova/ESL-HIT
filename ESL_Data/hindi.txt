Earth is the largest terrestrial planet among the other matter of the solar system. The Earth is also referred to as our Home World and Terra.1011_2 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	According to scientific evidence the planet was formed 4.54 billion years ago and life appeared on its surface about a billion years ago. Since then the atmosphere and abiotic conditions have changed so as to stop the broadcast of aerobic organisms and production of the ozone layer which along with the earth&#39;s magnetic fields stops dangerous radiation to penetrate enabling life on the planet.1011_3 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	The outer surface of the earth is divided into hard sections and plates which are displaced on the surface in many millions of years. Nearly 71% of the surface is covered with salt water and the remaining area is divided into continents and islands&#44; fresh water which is essential for life and whose availability is unknown on other planets. The earth&#39;s internal surface has active with a solid layer of mantle&#44; a liquid core which forms a magnetic field and a solid inner iron core.1011_4 	A13XN0JFSCA5BF 	Earth Intracts with other objects in outer space&#44; espacially sun and moon. At present earth orbits the sun once for every roughly 366.26 times it rotates on its axis&#44; which is equal to 365.26 solar days&#44; or one sidereal year. The Earth axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 away form the perpendicular to its orbital plane&#44; producing seasonal varition ont the planet&#39;s surface whith a period of one tropical year(365.24 solar days). Earth&#39;s only known natural satellite&#44; the moon&#44; which began orbiting it about 4.53 billion years ago&#44; provides ocean tides&#44; stabilizes the axial tilt and gradually slows the plane&#39;s rotation. Planet&#39;s early days numerous asteroid impacts during the late heay bombardment caused significant changes to the surface environment.1011_7 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The first atmosphere on earth was born by many gaseous and volcanic processes.  Water vapour&#44; ice and liquid water&#44; generated by the processes of insignificant and big ancient planets near Neptune and Pluto&#44; produced the oceans.  It is understood that about 4 billion years ago&#44; high energy chemical processes produced model atoms&#44; and half a billion years later&#44; last common ancestor of all life came into being.1011_8 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Light radiation from the sun enabled use of sun&#39;s energy in daily life&#44; as a result oxygen in the atmosphere reacted and got converted to a layer of ozone (a form of atomic oxygen [O3] in the upper atnosphere).  Evolution of complex organisms&#44; called eukaryotes&#44; happened by the combination of big and small cells.  Growth of multicellular living organisms happens specially well in colonies&#44; for their growth nuclear radiation is harmful and this radiation is reduced by the ozone layer&#44; and thereby life evolved on earth.1011_9 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Without any dry land in the beginnig&#44; the total area of the top surface of the oceans has been growing gradually during the last 2 billion years.

Occurrences like the volcanoes combined with the solar variations causedthe changes to go unnoticed in the years before 1950.26300_8 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	At least 30 scientific institutes and all national science  academies have proved and confirmed the truth in this conclusion.2646_10 	A2OCN0KL27QMTP 	The first commercially automated cellular network (the 1G generation) was launched in Japan by NTT in 1979&#44; initially in the metropolitan area of Tokyo. Fully working cellular  network had been expanded to cover the whole population of Japan from 1980 to mid 1980&#39;s and became the first nation-wide 1G network. In 1981&#44; this was followed by the simultaneous launch of the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system in Denmark&#44; Finland&#44; Norway and Sweden.2646_12 	A2OCN0KL27QMTP 	Private Mobiles phone system and modem used in Japan around 1997-2003&#44;Motorola TAC&#44; was the first mobile phone to be approved by the FCC in United States.n 1984&#44; Bell Labs developed modern commercial cellular technology (most of Gladden&#44; Parelman patent based)&#44; which contain multiple center base stations (cell sites) to be employed&#44; each used to service a small area (a cell). Cell sites were installed in such a way that the cells used to partially overlap. A cellular system&#44; a base station (cell site) and a terminal (phone) between the signal should only be so strong that it could reach between the two points&#44; in order to separate the different calls and use the same channel together.2646_14 	A2OCN0KL27QMTP 	Digital 2G (second generation) cellular technology was first &quot;modern&quot; network technology launced in Finland in 1991&#44; Radiolinja (now part of Elisa Group) was launched based on the GSM standard&#44; which marked the introduction of mobile telecommunications in the competition when the incumbent Radiolinja challenged Telecom Finland (now part of Teliasonera)  which was running a 1G NMT network.2646_15 	A2OCN0KL27QMTP 	The first data services appeared on mobile phones from person to person text messages in 1993. First test on a mobile phone  for payment was done for a Coca Cola machine in Finland in 1998. Sweden conducted the first Mobile parking trials. The first commercial payment system was first launched in Norway in 1999. Mimic Banks first commercial payment system for credit cards in the Philippines began in 1999 with mobile operators Globe and Smart. The first content sold to mobile phone was a ring tone&#44; which was introduced in Finland in 1998. i-mode on mobile phones was the first full Internet service in Japan by NTT DoCoMo which was introduced in 1999.2646_16 	A2OCN0KL27QMTP 	In 2001 first commercial launch of 3G3G (third generation)  was done in Japan by NTT DoCoMo with the WCDMA standard.2646_17 	A2OCN0KL27QMTP 	In 1990 &#44; after the start of the Motorola Micro TAC &#44; all mobile phone jacket pocket to take were big&#44; so they were usually used as vehicles car phones. Digital components&#44; miniature and more sophisticated With the development of batteries&#44; mobile phones have become smaller and lighter.2646_22 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	An encrypted circuit board inside the mobile telphone.2646_23 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	There are many types of mobile phones&#44; starting from the basic phone to the metamorphised phone like the musical phone and camera phone and smartphone. Nokia 9000 Communicator was the first smartphone which came in 1996&#44; and in which PDA technology was incorporated to face the then competition from other mobile phones. Many features to use miniaturisation and improved processing capability of the microchip were added&#44; expanded the concept of smartphone &#44; and a superior smartphone of five years ago&#44; is today a standard phone.  For a market segement&#44; many series of phones were introduced&#44; like RIM Blackberry centred / focussing on the business of need of email for the corporate customers; Musical phones of Sony Ericman&#39;s Walkman Seriesand camera phones of Cybershot Series; Multimedia phones of Nokia&#39;s N-Series; and Apple iPhone&#44; which presents all the specialities of web usage and multimedia technology.2646_26 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	In some phones&#44; touch screens are incorporated.2646_27 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Music&#44;downloading pictures&#44;video games&#44;entertainment&#44; gambling and video/television are popular attractions among mobile services2646_28 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Nokia and Cambridge university have claimed to have developed an ideal cellphone&#44; which is called &quot;Morph&quot;.2646_46 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	In the past&#44; Nickel metal-hydride was the most common form of the batteries of the mobile phones&#44; because its shape and weight are less.  Lithium ion-batteries were used now and then because of their light weight&#44; and voltage loss is not there like in the nickel metal-hydride batteries.  Many manufacturers of mobile phones started using&#44; in place of the old lithium-ion batteries&#44; lithium polymer batteries&#44; because in addition to being of low weight and density&#44; their main advantage is that they can be made in any other shape.  Manufacturers of mobile phones are experimenting with alternative energy sources&#44; including the solar cells.2646_49 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	In common mobile phones&#44; SIM card. For using the GSM mobile phone&#44; along with the battery&#44; a small microchip is necessary&#44; which is called the Subscriber Identity Module or SIM card.  Of apporximately the shape of a postal stamp&#44; the SIM card is kept below the battery at the back of the phone unit&#44; and (when acive in the correct way)it contains the data of the settings of the phone and the know-how details of the phone&#44; like what hosting plan the subscriber is using.  When the user removes the SIM card&#44; he can put it into a second phone and use it again as usual.2646_50 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Every SIM card is activated by using an uniquely numbered user identification; once activated&#44; identification is locked and in the active network gets connected indelibly.  For this reason&#44; most retail sellers refuse to to take back an activated SIM card.2646_52 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	MSL ensures that the service provider gets payment for the phones purchased or taken on lease.  For example&#44; the price of Motorola RAZR V9C is more than that of CAD 00.  In about 00&#44; depending on the carrier&#44; you can get one.  The difference is paid in the form of the monthly bills from the customer.  If the customer has not used one MSL&#44; then he loses the difference of 00 - 00&#44; which will be settled in his monthly bills&#44; because some customers cancel their present service and go to a second carrier for taking a phone.2646_53 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	NSL is put on the SIM&#44; only because of this once it is locked&#44; even after the agreement&#44; it still is there on the SIM.  Even though&#44; MSL is locked in the beginning itself by the manufacturer.  This lock can be made ineffective&#44; so that the phone can be used with the SIM card of other service providers.  Phones purchased outside America are open phones because there for most phones&#44; many service providers are close or wide spread.  The expenses to unlock the phones are different but on an average very cheap and are sometimes offered by the independent phone sellers.2646_54 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	When away from the usual coverage area&#44; an open phone to the travelling users is of immense convinience.  Service provider has to charge extra to provide service to them&#44; and MSL is useful in such situation.  This additional expense for an international call can be 10 times more compared to the calls from the phone without roaming&#44; even after discounts.  According to the FAQ&#44; T-Mobile gives a code to its subscribers to open a SIM after 90 days of stable use.2646_55 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	For example&#44; in Jamaica&#44; a AT&amp;T customer opted for an international service. Additional payment of 65 per minute can be made&#44; whereas a B-Mobile (Jamaica) customer has to pay for an equivalent international service /bin/sh.20 for every minute.  Some service providers focus on international sales&#44; whereas some others on regional sales.  For example&#44; The National Phone Company of Jamaica&#44; Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) Company&#39;s position is that the same B-phone customers spend less on local calls and more on international calls.  This difference is mainly because of the currency conversion&#44; because SIM card is purchased in local currency.  In America&#44; there is no competition for such services because some prominent service providers do not offer settle-when-you-quit service.  [settlement-when-you-quit requirements Reference&#44; T-Mobile Report&#44; Offer to Verizon One&#44; AT&amp;T not till 12/2008]2646_58 	A3T5285F7WI9HT 	Nokia was the largest mobile phone manufacturer in third quarter of 2008 with 39.4% market share followed by Samsung with 17.3%&#44;Sony Ericsson with 8.6%&#44;Motorola with 8.5% and LG Electronics with 7.7%.These manufacturers sold 80% of the mobile phones at that time.2646_61 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	In 1998 mobile phone became media channel when first ringtone sold by Radiolinja in Finland. Soon other media content appeared such as news&#44; videogames&#44; jokes&#44; horoscopes&#44; TV content and advertising. In 2006 total value of mobile phone paid media content exceeded internet paid media content and was worth 31 Billion dollars (Source Informa 2007). In 2007 music value on the phone was worth 9.30 Billion dollars while gaming value was worth 5 Billion dollars (Source Nersize Guide 2008).2646_62 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Mobile phone is actually considered the fourth screen (if we count as the first three screens cinema&#44; TV ad PC screens) or it is the third (if we count as the first two&#44; TV and PC screens).  This is also called the seventh in the mass media (first six being print&#44; recording&#44; cinema&#44; radio&#44; TV and internet).  The beginning limbs of the mobile phone are the copies of legacy media&#44; like banner advertisements or video clips of TV news.  Recently&#44; unique limbs are developed for the mobile&#44; starting from ring tones and return ring tones to &quot;mobisode&quot;&#44; video programs designed to be viewed on mobile phones.2646_67 	ADC8VBKOVOCRR 	A type of telephone which can be permanently mounted&#44; these often have more powerful transmitters&#44; there is an external antenna and loud speaker for hands free use.

Soor&#39;s travel song is not only a medium of describing separation but also describes the good and the bad forces.3485_81 	A3R0SD14UE0QQW 	This mainly consists of comedy and comments between Udhav and Gopi.3485_82 	A370556EFVZ9W4 	10. One can find a deep and elaborate description of nature in Soor&#39;s poems.3485_84 	A3R0SD14UE0QQW 	Sur&#39;s poem beautifully describes the heartily emotions.3485_85 	A370556EFVZ9W4 	One can see the effect of a devoted and religious mind in several posts of Soor.3485_86 	A1JNPLDD2U8VUC 	The poems of Soor are great not only in expression of feelings but also in projecting the art.3485_87 	A370556EFVZ9W4 	Soor&#39;s language is easy&#44; natural and comprehendable.3485_89 	A3NOO9K3CY1YU5 	Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi writes on the poetic power of Surdas like this- You have to agree that when Surdas begins to describe his loved subject&#44; the rule-book of ornamental language runs behind him with folded hands.3485_90 	A3NOO9K3CY1YU5 	Floods of similes flow and a rain of images start coming.3485_91 	A3NOO9K3CY1YU5 	From this we could see that Surdas was a great poet of Hindi literature because he did not decorate his literary works just with emotions and language alone but created a special tradition of Krishna-poetic drama3485_92 	A3NOO9K3CY1YU5 	Specialties of the stream of Krishna-poetic drama3485_94 	A3NOO9K3CY1YU5 	He spread the cult of Krishna giving prominence to the ideals of Nimbark&#44; Madhwa and Vishnuswamy3485_95 	A21CDLZGS75IFQ 	Considering the ways of spreading Krishna&#39;s teachings of sri vallanhacharya he wrote poetry of krishna Bhakti.3485_96 	A12J6U15W1MWZ 	Vallabhacharya spread propaganda of Pushtimarg3485_97 	A21CDLZGS75IFQ 	The essence of it was to gain the blessings of Lord krishna by worshipping Him.3485_99 	A3NOO9K3CY1YU5 	1.The main subject of Srikrishna-literature was singing the playful activities of Krishna.39074_0 	A33JHWO2DAM9TZ 	One general physical psychological related activity is sex.39074_1 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Masturbation or exciting the sexual organs by oneself is a process indulged in commonly by boys and girls alike.  Scientifically&#44; it is established that there is no harm by this process.  Here the methods of self excitement of sexual organs by women are being discussed&#44; which give them unlimited sensual pleasure and also give them intense arousal&#44; whether she alone or with her partner.  If women did not arouse their sex organs by self&#44; there is a possibility that they are being deprived of adequate  excitement from the sex act.

The last essay can be called as his program related with economy. He also wrote briefly about vegetarianism&#44; Food and health&#44; religion&#44; social progress. Normally he used to write in Gujrathi but he also used to translate his books in to Hindi and English.872_242 	A1FDJA0BZATTZC 	Gandhi&#39;s entire work was published by Indian government in 1960 as Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s Accumulated Articles. This writing is published in around 50000 pages and approximately hundred parts. In year 2000 the researched version was in controversy because Gandhi&#39;s followers blamed government due changes made in it for political purposes.872_246 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Political events and important leaders were influenced by Gandhi. In the Civils Rights Movement of America&#44; Martin Luther King and James Lawson were attracted by Gandhian principles of Non violence as written in his articles.Apartheid leader and the former President of South Africa&#44; Nelson Mandela was inspired by Gandhiji. Others were Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan&#44; Steve Biko and Aung San Suu Kyi.872_247 	A2CSX5G96MCRHK 	The advices and life of Gandhi inspired many and some of them  considered him as their teacher&#44; and some others dedicated their life towards spreading the principles and ideologies of Gandhi.Roman Roland was one among them  and he discussed about Gandhi in his book Mahathma Gandhi.The famous Brazilian Anarchist and Feminist Maria Lacerda de wrote about Gandhi in her book Santhivadi.Famous scientist Albert Einstein used to write to Gandhi in 1931 and in one of his letters he portrayed  Gandhi as the &#39; role model for the future&#39;.Lanza del Vasto was influenced by Gandhiji&#39;s principles and he came to India so as to live with Gandhi in 1936 and after he went back to Europe to spread his  ideologies and as he established community of the Ark in 1948 in Europe. Madeleine (Meera Behan)who was the daughter of a British Naval officer spent most her life time as a follower of Gandhi in India.872_248 	A3P2WQO8VESWF2 	In addition to this&#44; British musician John Lennon referred to Gandhi when he was expressing his opinions on nonviolence. In 2007 in the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival&#44; the former vice president of America and environmentalist has told about the influence of Gandhi on him.872_252 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	A statue commemorating 100 years of Gandhi was unveiled in the central business district of Pietermaritzburg in South Africa.872_253 	A2CSX5G96MCRHK 	October 2nd is the Birthday of Gandhi  and this is observed as National Holiday in India.In 14th June 2007 the United Nations General Assembly announced October 2nd as International Day of Non-Violence.872_254 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Generally the word Mahatma is misunderstood in western countries. This word comes from a sanskrit word. Maha means great whereas atma means soul.According to Dutta and Robinson&#44; the title of Mahatma was given to Gandhiji by Rabindranath Tagore. Other sources claim that this titile was bestowed upon him by Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta on 21st January 1915. In his autobiography Gandhiji states that he is not worthy of this title.But it is true that he is said to be a mahatma for his pursuit of justice and non violence.872_257 	AOG9H27586IOW 	Gandhi&#39;s memorial in Moscow.872_259 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	Indian government&#44; during 1996 released started a series of 1&#44; 5&#44; 10&#44; 20&#44; 50&#44; 100&#44; 500 and 1000 denomination notes with a print of Mahatma Gandhi. All the notes in use today have a picture of Mahatma Gandhi on them. In 1969 the United Kingdom released a series of postage stamps on the Centennial Jubilee of Mahatma Gandhi.872_261 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	The Gandhi Memorial in new Delhi symbolizes the place where he was assassinated.872_262 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	In United Kingdom&#44; idols of Gandhiji are installed at famous places like at the Tavistock Square near the University College London as he studied law there. United Kingdom observes January 30 as National Gandhi Memorial Day. In the United States&#44; the idols of Mahatma Gandhi are installed outside the Union Square&#44; New York&#44; at the Martin Luther King&#44; Jr. National Historic Site&#44; Atlanta and on Massachusetts street near the India Embassy&#44; Washington D.C.   Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s idol is also installed at Pietermaitzburg&#44; South Africa where he was asked to leave the first class compartment of a train in 1893. Gandhiji&#39;s idols are also present at Madam Tussaud&#39;s wax museams in London&#44; New York and other cities of the world.872_263 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	Gandhiji never received a Nobel Prize for peace though he was nominated for it 5 times during 1936 and 1947 which also included a nomination from the American Friends Service Committee. The Nobel Committee declared after decades that it regretted their mistake and also accepted that the reason for not awarding him this prize was his Split national ideology. Mahatma Gandhi was to receive this prize in 1948 but it could not proceed due to his assassination. Another reason was the formation Indian and Pakistan the two new countries which were at war. During 1948 the prize was given as there was no candidate alive. And when Dalai Lama was awarded this prize the president of the committee stated that this was a part of tribute offered to Mahatma Gandhi.872_267 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	The Birla Bhavan or Birla House where Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated was acquired by India on January 30&#44; 1971 and opened it to the citizens as the Gandhi Memorial.  It has the room where Gandhiji had spent his last four months and also the garden where he was assassinated while taking a walk. A martyr stone marks the place where he was assassinated.872_268 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	January 30th is observed as Mahatma Gandhis death anniversary and in many countries it is observed as a school day of non-violence and peace (DENIP). This was initiated in Spain during 1964. All the countries that follow the southern hemisphere calendar observe this day.872_270 	A2YYSK3D0KRFN 	The effect of Gandhis severe ahimsa is pacifism&#44; which is the basic reason of criticism from political sector.872_272 	AA4XJ5YP5SLN2 	Gandhiji was against the Partition of India and pakistan because it divides the unity of 2 major religions. He has written in the book of Harijan that he was not in favour of Partition on 6th Mar 1946872_273 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	(The demand of Pakistan) as presented by the Muslim League is anti-Muslim and I will not hesitate to call it sinful.  Islam stands for the brotherhood and unity of the humanity&#44; not for opposing the unity of the mankind.  Therefore&#44; those who want India to be converted into two warring groups are enemies of both India and Islam.  They can cut me into pieces&#44; but cannot make me compromise on what I consider wrong [...]we must not give up hope&#44; though it is quixotically being said that we have to keep Muslims imprisoned in our love.872_274 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Even so&#44; taking into account a long  correspondence between Gandhi and Jinna on the issue of Pakistan&#44; Jack Holmer says - &quot;Though Gandhi was personally against partition&#44; he gave an indication of his agreement&#44; based on which Congress and Muslim League in the temporary Government came to an agreement to first get the freedom and later decide on the question of partition by popular vote in the districts where Muslims were in majority&quot;...872_275 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Keeping a double stand like this on the issue of Indian partition&#44; Gandhi opened the areas of perceptions from both Hindus and Muslims.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah and contemporary Pakistanis accused Gandhi of undermining the political rights of the Muslims.  Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his colleagues blamed Gandhi and accused that he was coaxing the Muslims&#44; that he was indifferent to the crimes committed against the Hindus&#44; and that he had already accepted the formation of Pakistan (though he publicly announced that he may be cut into two pieces before partition).  This is even today politically debatable&#44; as Pakistani-American historian Ayesha Jalal gives the logic that Gandhi and Congress were not willing to share power with Muslim League.  Other Hindu nationalist and political leader Pravin Togadia also considers this issue in the leadership of Gandhi&#44; and also suggests that partition happened because of the extreme weakness of his group.872_277 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	I have received many letters asking me to declare my stand on the persecution of the Jews in Germany and on Arab-Jews.  It is not like I can give my answer to this difficult question without any scruples.  My sympathy is with the Jews.  I know them closely from the time I was in South Africa&#44; and some of them have become my friends for life.  I came to know about the long persecution through these friends only.  They have been kept as untouchables in Jews religion.  But my sympathy will not take me away from reason.  Dfivision of a nation for the Jews does not appeal to me.  Is sanction there in the Bible and on what basis are they asking for Philippine in return?  Why do they&#44; who love other people in the world&#44;  not make home in the country where they are born and where they are earning a livelihood?  Palestine belongs to Arabs&#44; just as as England belongs to British and France to the French.  It is improper and finhuman for the Jews to rule over the Arabs.  Whatever is happening today in Palestine can not be proved right from any perspective of customs and good practices.872_279 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Those who wanted to get freedom through violence&#44; their thinkings also brouoght some political fire.  His refusal to talk against the hanging of Bhagat Singh&#44; Sukhdev&#44; Udam Singh and Rajguru became a reason for blaming him in some groups.872_280 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Fro this comment&#44; Gandhi said&#44; &quot;there was a time when people listened to me on how to fight the British without weapons&#44; because then there were no weapons.... But today I am being told that my non-violence is of no use because it cannot stop the strife between Hindus and Muslims&#44; therefore it is necessary to be armed for self defence&quot;.872_282 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	If I were a Jew born in Germany&#44; I would have been living in Germany and would have considered Germany as my mother country. Even if a fellow German would have threatened to kill me or imprison me in the darkest jail&#44; I would never give in to accepting something which in my opinion is not right.This is why I will wait for my Jewish brothers to join me in my stand against the wrongful things.I am&#44; in fact&#44; confident that everyone will regard me as a model&#44; and follow my actions.If one or all Jews accept the method stated here&#44;their living conditions will not deteriorate more than they have till now.If they succeed in tolerating the pain given to them&#44; they will attain internal power and happiness. This will be the first revolt against the actions of Hitler&#44; who has indulged in manslaughter and planned violence.If the minds of the Jews learn to tolerate pain voluntarily&#44; the day of death will also transform into a Thanksgiving Day or a joyous day.Just like Jihova gave his whole tribe in the hands of a tyrant. One who fears God does not feel the fear of death.872_283 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Gandhi was extensively criticized for such statements&#44;and in his article&quot;Question of Jews&quot;&#44; he has defended his opinions.In addition&#44; my friends have sent me two clippings of a newspaper article which criticize my opinions and appeals.They say that the solution that I have suggested to the problem is in no way innovative.My only view is that if violence is abandoned from within he heart&#44; it will give a way for knowledge to enter.He published these views in &quot;Answers to Jewish Friends&quot; and &quot;Jews and Palestine&quot;&#44; that if violence is given up&#44; it will create a place for knowledge to enter&#44; and also bestow the satisfaction of having giving up a bad thought.872_284 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Interpretation by Gandhi of the self sacrifice of the Jews invited many commentators criticism.  Martin Buber&#44; who is himself an opponent of Jewish state&#44; on 24 February 1939&#44; wrote a fiercely critical letter to Gandhi.  Buber firmly said that the practices of British with Indians are different from those of Nazis with Jews&#44; in addition when the Indians were victims of torture&#44; on some occassions Gandhi supported use of might.872_285 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Gandhiji referred the injustice of Jews in Germany as a Satyagriha(peaceful pursuit of peace).In November 1938&#44; he suggested non violence to the wronged Jews&#44; as a solution to the Nazi injustice.872_288 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Introductory lesson on South Africa.872_289 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Gandhijis earlier articles from South Africa have been highly debated. On 7th March 1908&#44; Gandhiji&#44; in the &quot;Indian Opinion&quot;&#44; wrote about his imprisonment in South Africa. He wrote that &quot;It seems an uncivilized rule&#44; moreso when one is a prisoner.Prisoners live difficult&#44; dirty lives like animals.&quot; In 1903&#44; He wrote&#44; &quot;I believe that I also belong to a pure race&#44; as they do.But i agree that the whites in South Africa should be considered as a higher race.&quot; In his days in South Africa&#44; Gandhiji often opposed the unfair treatment of Indians by the whites&#44; and he describes this as&#44;&quot;It is definitely better than the Kaffirs.&quot;It is worth considering that the meaning of Kaffirs in Gandhiji&#39;s times was quite different than its meaning today.Gandhiji&#44; in his articles&#44; has urged some people in declaring themselves as a higher race.872_290 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Two professors of history Surendra Bhana and Gulam Wahed&#44; who had a command of South African history&#44; made an analysis of this argument in their basic book&#44; The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa&#44; 1893 - 1894 (New Delhi: Manohar&#44; 2005).  The focus of the first chapter&#44; &quot;Gandhi&#44; native Africans and Indians in colonial condition&quot; is on &quot;White Rule&quot;&#44; on the relationship of Indian and African communities and on those policies because of which they were divided (and they argue that the conflict between these communities was big).  They say about these relationships&#44; &quot;young Gandhi&#44; in 1890 was influenced by those divisive thoughts prevalent then&quot;.  Alongside&#44; they also say this&#44; &quot;The experience of Gandhi in jail made him more sensitive about their condition  ..later Gandhi become stronger; he became less definitive in his expression of his prejudice&#44; and on several levels began seeing common points of equality&#44; in the jail of Johannesberg&#44; in his negative way of seeing&#44; there were no stubborn Africa inmates nor average Africans&quot;.872_291 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	The Former President of South Africa&#44; Nelson Mandela&#44; is a folower of Gandhiji.In 2003&#44;he unveiled a statue of Gandhi in Johannsberg in spite of strong opposition by Gandhijis critics.Bhana and Wahed have described events that happened during the unveiling of the statue&#44; in their book&#44; The Making Of A Political Reformer:Gandhi In South Africa&#44;1913-1914.In the Chapter&#44; Gandhijis gift to South Africa&#44;They write&#44;&quot;Gandhiji inspired active reformers in South Africa to end white superiority. This links his vies with that of Nelson Mandela.This means that what work was started by Gandhiji was ended by Nelson Mandela.They continue with descriptions of events that took place at the time of the unveiling of the statue of Gandhiji.Bhana and Wahed say&#44;&quot;Those people took the support of Gandhiji&#39;s views because they wanted to fulfil their desire to attain important political positions. Those views that declared them as those of a lower race and called them terrorists/revolutionaries&#44; did not help them to better their political standing.872_293 	AOG9H27586IOW 	Gandhi- enemy of state: The state of vision he envisaged was India not be a subordinate under any Government&#44; he opined that a nation should have true self rule meaning every person rules himself&#44; so that let it not be a nation in which it imposes any law on the people&#44; on many occasions he described himself to be a philosophical anarchist. He meant that an independent Indias integrity depended on thousands of small self dependent provinces ruled on its own&#44; which does not mean the established administrative system be given over to Indian nationals for which he remarked converting Hindustan to Englishstan. The British type of Parliamentary system on which he did not believe in&#44; he wished after Indian independence wanted to dismantle the Congress party and establish direct democratic system.872_300 	AOG9H27586IOW 	Bhana&#44; Surendra&#44; and Ghulam Wahed :The Making of A Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa&#44;1893-1914&#44; New Delhi 2005.872_301 	A1DA91W9F7L8XT 	Bondurant&#44; Juaan Vi.

A spinner will often &quot;buy his wicket&quot; by &quot;tossing one up&quot; (in a slower&#44; higher parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot.The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often &quot;flighted&quot; or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be &quot;trapped&quot; into getting himself out.884_102 	A2OCN0KL27QMTP 	In between the pacemen and the spinners are the &quot;medium pacers&quot; who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman&#39;s concentration.884_104 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	During the bowling action the elbow may be held at any angle and may bend further&#44; but may not straighten out. If the elbow straightens illegally then the square-leg umpire may call no-ball: The current laws allow a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less.884_106 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	At any one time&#44; there are two batsmen in the playing area. One takes station at the striker&#39;s end to defend the wicket and to score runs if possible. His partner&#44; the non-striker&#44; is at the end where the bowler is operating.884_107 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	Batsmen come in to bat in a batting order&#44; decided by the team captain. The first two batsmen  the &quot;openers&quot;  usually face the hostile bowling from fresh fast bowlers with a new ball. The top batting positions are usually given to the most competent batsmen in the team&#44; and the non-batsmen typically bat last. The pre-announced batting order is not mandatory and when a wicket falls any player who has not yet batted may be sent in next.884_109 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	A skilled batsman can use a wide array of &quot;shots&quot; or &quot;strokes&quot; in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat&#39;s blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an &quot;edge&quot;. Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible&#44; and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply &quot;blocking&quot; the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run.884_110 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Different varieties of shots are played in cricket. The strokes played by a batsman are given different names like &quot;cut&quot;&#44; &quot;drive&quot;&#44; &quot;hook&quot; or &quot;pull&quot; depending upon the swing or direction of the ball.884_111 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	Note that a batsman does not have to play a shot and can &quot;leave&quot; the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper&#44; providing he thinks it will not hit his wicket. Equally&#44; he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. He can deliberately use his leg to block the ball and thereby &quot;pad it away&quot; but this is risky because of the leg before wicket rule.884_112 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	In the event of an injured batsman being fit to bat but not to run&#44; the umpires and the fielding captain may allow another member of the batting side to be a runner. The runner&#39;s only task is to run between the wickets instead of the injured batsman. The runner is required to wear and carry exactly the same equipment as the incapacitated batsman. It is possible for both batsmen to have runners.884_115 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	It is possible to make more than a single run with a single hit. One to three runs are common in a single hit. The shape of the field is such that it is not possible to score more than four runs.To avoid disadvantage due to its size&#44; a hit is said to score four runs if the ball touches the boundary line.If the ball crosss the boundary without a bounce&#44; it is said to score 6 runs.There is no need for a player to run between the wickets if the ball crosses the boundary.884_116 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Scoring 5 runs is very rare&#44; and occurs only in case of an overthrow by a player returning the ball from near the boundary. The batsmen change sides if the batsman scores an odd number of runs. The striker&#44; then becomes the non-striker&#44; and vice versa. The runs scored by the striker is added to his personal total as well as that of the entire team.884_117 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	A batsman has experience of estimating how many runs he can score by the distance to which he has hit the ball&#44; and he signals this to the non striker by words like Yes or No or Stop.884_118 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	There is  alot of risk in taking runs because if one fieldsman strikes the wicket&#44; when the nearest batsman is out of his crease(means no part of his body or the bat is in touch with the crease)batsman is said to be run out.884_121 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The runs obtained by the batting side because of the mistakes committed by the fielding side are called Extras. (In Australia these are called &quot;sundries&quot;). These can be obtained in four ways:884_122 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	A &quot;No Ball&quot; is an extra ball that a bowler has to bowl as a punishment for breaking a rule while bowling.(1) unnecessary swing of arms (2)overstepping the popping crease (3)If his foot falls over the return crease.According to current rules&#44; the extra ball being bowled for this reason is said to be a Free-hit in 20-20 matches and ODIs. This means that the batsman cannot be given out in any case except a run-out.884_123 	A1FDJA0BZATTZC 	Wide- An extra ball given as penalty when bowler bowl such a ball which is out of reach of the batsman.884_125 	A2G15LYFSOEBV5 	When the ball hits body of the batsman but not his bat&#44; the runs scored are accounted as extra runs and is known as Leg Bye&#44; it also allows the batsman to take runs by running between the wickets.884_126 	A2G15LYFSOEBV5 	Whenever a bowler bowls a wide ball or a no ball&#44; it not only penalizes the bowling team as they have to bowl an extra bowl but it also enables the batsman to score run by running between the wickets&#44; so that he can claim the bye or leg bye runs  (except when ball reaches the boundary). However these runs are add to the total score of team and not to the striker&#39;s individual tally.884_128 	A3I17NEOCU7A28 	A batsman can be out by ten ways and some of them are so extraordinary that very few examples can be found in the whole history of this game. The general ways of getting out are &quot;Bowled&quot;&#44; &quot;Caught&quot;&#44; &quot;LBW&quot;&#44; &quot;Run out&quot;&#44; &quot;Stumped&quot;&#44; and &quot;Hit Wicket&quot;. Extra-ordinary ways are &quot;Hit the ball twice&quot;&#44; &quot;Obstruct the field&quot;&#44; &quot;Handle the ball&quot; and &quot;Time out&quot;.884_130 	A3I17NEOCU7A28 	It is done by speaking or shouting. and it means &quot;How is that?&quot;.884_131 	A2G15LYFSOEBV5 	If the umpire finds the appeal right&#44; then he agrees to the bowler and lifts his index finger to say out.884_132 	A2G15LYFSOEBV5 	Otherwise&#44; he refuses and say &#39;Not Out&#39;. The appeal is in the form of a shout when the bowling team is not sure about the result. It usually happens in case of LBW and run out.884_133 	A2G15LYFSOEBV5 	Bowled; if the bowler hits the wicket in such a way that at least one wicket falls and bail is dislodged from its actual position (it is worth noticing that if the ball hits the wickets and the bails are not dislodged then it will be considered a snot out)884_135 	AVWWDENWU115I 	Leg before wicker(Leg before wicket)(LBW): this is complex but its basic meaning is that&#44; if the ball first touch the leg of the batsmen then the batsman is out884_136 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	Run out - It happens when one player of the fielding side hits the ball on the wicket when batsman is not in the crease; this generally happens when batsman try to takes a run and a good throw breaks off the wickets.884_137 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	Stumped is similar except that it is done by the wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground&#44;if wicket keeper has broken the stumps.884_138 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	Hit wicket : This happens when batsman while hitting the ball or taking a run by mistake touches the wicket and one or both bails fall either by his bat&#44; clothes or something else.884_140 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	Obstructed the field: another unusual dismissal which tends to involve a batsman deliberately getting in the way of a fielder.884_141 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	Handled the ball: a batsman must not deliberately touch the ball with his hand&#44; for example to protect his wicket (note that the bowled ball often hits the batsman&#39;s hand while it is holding the bat but this is not out; though he can of course be caught off his hand)884_142 	AVWWDENWU115I 	Timed out (Timed out); If a batsman does not arrive on the field within two minutes from the time of the dismissal of the previous batsman884_143 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	In the vast majority of cases&#44; it is the striker who is out when a dismissal occurs. If the non-striker is dismissed it is usually by being run out&#44; but he could also be dismissed for obstructing the field&#44; handling the ball or being timed out.884_147 	A3NMRXYNBNFNUT 	10 out of the 11 batsmen are declared out; in this situation a team is declared &quot;all out&quot;.884_148 	A33JHWO2DAM9TZ 	If in a team only one player is remained who can bat&#44; and other remaining one or more players because of  injury&#44; sickness or absent cannot be available in that case team is declared as &quot;all out&quot;884_150 	A1V6P1ZE6Q8YEW 	Only set number are overs are bowled&#44; (50 overs in an one day match and 20 overs in a Twenty 20)884_151 	A3NMRXYNBNFNUT 	A team captain can end his innings by declaring it. the condition required is that two of the teams batsmen should be not-out (This does not apply to One day International matches).884_153 	A3NMRXYNBNFNUT 	If the team playing second is unable to score as many runs as the opposing team then the team batting loses by n runs. (Here n represents the difference of runs between the two teams). If the team batting second scores the required number of runs&#44; then the batting team wins by n wickets&#44; where n represents the number of wickets that have not fallen. For example&#44; if a team batting second loses six wickets and achieves the required number of runs&#44; then that team &quot;wins the match by 4 wickets&quot;.884_155 	AOG9H27586IOW 	If at the end&#44; batting team is all out&#44; and both the sides have made equal runs&#44; then the match becomes a tie. This result is very rare in the tradition of the game&#44; if before a team could win&#44; the time is over then the game is declared a draw.884_156 	A3IEMHCG2FU56T 	Each side in the match is only a shift for every shift of the maximum number of balls are often made sure the match like &quot;limited-overs match&quot; or &quot;one-day&quot; is called&#44; and the number of wickets regardless of the higher scoring team wins. The fluid can not&#44; if this type of match to be temporarily interrupted due to bad weather is a complex mathematical formula that duckworth-louis method is called by his middle score a new target is then calculated. Also one-day &quot;results-free&quot; may be declared if one team has been put over by the predetermined conditions such as wet weather caused a further game can be played884_158 	A21SQXRIC135J6 	In comprehensive meaning&#44; Cricket is a multi-dimensional game&#44; which can be divided into major cricket and minor cricket according to game scales. One more proper division&#44; especially in terms of Major cricket&#44; is done in matches&#44; in which there are total 2 innings&#44; and each team has to play one inning. It was earlier known as first-class cricket. Its duration is 3 to 5 days.(There are examples of such matches also where there is no time limit); Later they were known as limited overs cricket because typically each team bowls the limited 50 overs.

Eight years later&#44; other national parties got status for test: South Africa(1889)&#44; West Indies(1928)&#44; New Zealand(1929)&#44; India(1932)&#44; Pakistan(1952)&#44; Sri Lanka(1982)&#44; Zimbabwe(1992) and Bangladesh(2000).884_165 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Whether Welsh players are considered part of the English team or not is fully dependant on the English team.The team of the West Indies consists of players from many Caribbean states-Barbados&#44;Guyana&#44; jamaica&#44; Trinidad and Tobago&#44; Leeward islands and the Wind Ward Islands.884_166 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Generally Test Matches are played between two teams in groups which is called a &quot;series&quot;.

Test Matches which do not end within the allotted time are taken to be a draw.884_167 	A2V3FO3J6XUPQK 	After 1882&#44; a test series is played between England and Australia for a trophy which is known as &quot;The Ashes&quot;. There are also some other series which have their own trophies&#44; for example&#44; Wised Trophy for which tournament between England and West Indies is played; Frank Worrell Trophy for which tournament between Australia and West Indies is played.884_170 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	If such matches are stopped during a day because of bad weather&#44; they are continued the next day.The aim of a Limited overs match is to get a definite outcome. There is no possibility of a match ending in a &quot;draw&quot;. The only possibility of a result being undeclared is when the match ends in a &quot;tie&quot;&#44; or the match having being stopped due to bad weather.Each team plays a single innings and faces a limited number of overs.Generally the overs are set for 40 or 50. In a 20-20 match&#44; each team plays just for 20 overs. During the Hobart Limited Overs International Match884_171 	A2JPXAF2MC24F7 	Standard Limited Overs Cricket was started in England in the 1963 season when a competition amongst the first class county clubs was held for a knockout cup.

Tennis balls and home made bats are used&#44; and many types of things are used as wickets&#44; for example&#44; in French Cricket&#44; biter leg.  This basically did not originate in France&#44; and mostly played by small children.  Sometimes the rules are improved: like&#44; fields man can catch the ball after one bounce in one hand.

That sounds like Old French word Criquet which means a kind of stick or club. In Samuel johnson&#39;s directory&#44; he described cricket as &quot;cryce&quot; which means Saskon-A Stick. One more probable evidence is middle dutch word krickstoel which means - a long beneath stul which is used in church for resting knee&#44; that looks like old age long two wicket and stumps.

The same year Civil war started in Spain&#44; which made Germany and Italy support the Nationalist forces which with the assistance of Soviet Union was against the Republic.

If GErmany attacks the Soviet Union&#44; France and England will never offer support&#44; hence it joined hands with Germany and got a Non Aggression Pact signed&#44; under which Germany would not attack he Soviet Union.This pact was also said to secretly hold plans about the division of Poland and Eastern Europe.10164_36 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	After the attack on Poland&#44; the Soviet Union turned its armies on the Baltic countries like Latvia&#44; Estonia and Lithuania.

sin-destroyer&#44; salvation giver&#44;Best river and mega-river in Rig Veda&#44; Mahabharata&#44; Ramayana and many Puranas.2403_244 	A112IE8PQYXT3Q 	Sanskrit poet Jagannath Roy has wrote a poem named &#39;Shri Gangalehri&#39; in the praise of Ganga.2403_245 	A112IE8PQYXT3Q 	Ganga has been described in the old epics of Hindi named Prithviraj Raso and Visaldev Ras (Narpati Nalha).2403_246 	A112IE8PQYXT3Q 	Most famous epic of older times &#39;Aalh Khand&#39; written by &#39;Jaagnik&#39; contains description of Ganga&#44; Yamuna and Sarawati.2403_248 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Shringari poet Vidyapati&#44; Kabirwani and Jaisi&#39;s Padmawat mention the Ganges. Tulsidas and Surdas have stressed the importance of the Ganga in detail.2403_249 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	In poems of Goswami Tulsidas&#44;The latter verses have stressed the importance of the Ganga in three chapters.In these&#44; the poet states the importance of seeing the Ganga&#44; bathing in it&#44; drinking its holy waters and settling down on its banks.2403_250 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Later&#44; descriptions of the Ganges by Senapati and Padmakar are important.2403_251 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Padmakar has written a book called &quot;Gangalahari&quot;&#44; which describes the importance and holyness of the Ganga.2403_253 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Ras Khan&#44; Rahim&#44; etc have also gaven beautiful descriptin of the Ganges.2403_254 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	In modern times&#44; Jagannath Ratnakar&#39;s book &quot;Gangavtaran&quot; tells the story of incarnation of Bhagirath on the shores of the Ganga for the purpose of blessing the 60&#44;000 sons of Sagar&#44; who was cursed by Kapil Muni.2403_255 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	The whole book is divided into 13 parts with 16 verses each.2403_256 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Other poets like Bhartendu Harishchandra&#44; Sumitranandan Pant and Shridhar Pathak have also stated the importance of the Ganga.2403_258 	A1QSGFHXZNVJOA 	The depiction of Ghreeshm Kaleen Taapas Bala Gangaa by Sumitranandan Pant in &quot;Nauka Vihar&quot; is vivacious.2403_259 	A2IKFQQ6A9JVIT 	He has also written a poem named Ganga.2403_260 	A2IKFQQ6A9JVIT 	Jahawarlal Nehru in his book &#39;Discovery of India&#39; has described the symbolic meanings of Ganga.2403_261 	A2IKFQQ6A9JVIT 	Ancient stories of ganga have been collected and compiled bu Mahender Mittal in his book &#39;Ma Ganga&#39;2403_269 	A3M58JENI5651B 	Category: Geography of Uttarakhand2403_270 	A3M58JENI5651B 	Category: Geography of Uttar Pradesh2403_271 	A3M58JENI5651B 	Category: Rivers of Uttar Pradesh2403_274 	A3M58JENI5651B 	Category: Geography of West Bangal2403_275 	A3M58JENI5651B 	Category: Rivers of West Bangal26300_10 	A3P2WQO8VESWF2 	Majority of the working scientists have agreed with the main findings of IPCC.26300_11 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	On the basis of a Climate model created by the IPCC&#44; average geological temperature of the earth is likely to rise in the 21st century.26300_12 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Differences in results and scenarios are because of differences in measurement of the greenhouse gases. Different standards have been set up regarding climate sensitivity&#44; though major research on this has been done till 2100.Though the emission of greenhouse gases can be stopped&#44; the warming and the rise in oceanic levels is inevitable.26300_13 	A3T5285F7WI9HT 	Rise in ocean temperature has caused difficulty in getting ideal conditions.26300_15 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Other scientific uncertainties may cause global warming in the future&#44; and the difference in heat in different parts of the world. Most national governments have signed the Kyoto Protocol and have acknowledged it.Kyoto Protocol aims at minimizing the amounts of greenhouse gases&#44; but it has been a topic of debate among political groups of the world&#44; as to whether they should minimize the warming&#44; or reverse it or adapt the changes caused on earth.26300_17 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	In recent decades&#44; Global Warming is defined as the creation and existence of warming of the earth and its effect on the living conditions.26300_18 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	The emission of substances existing on the earth is defined by the United Nations as the evaporation of water and other substances into a gaseous form by the actions of man.26300_20 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	The term &quot; Enthropogenic Global Warming&quot; has been used several times in reference to the changes in the environment caused due to human factors.26300_25 	A7N3BRBS77RH1 	IPCC Fourth Assessment Report estimated current radiative forcing as a factor26300_26 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	The emitted gases change their form under influence of the orbital forcing and their revolution in an orbit around the sun is also classified under this.26300_28 	A1ESKJFDQUMBL4 	Causes of the recent warming after the recent scientific consensus&#44; are the subject of research.26300_29 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Most of the increase in temperature arising out of increase in the environmental green house gases from manmade processes is seen after the start of the industrial era.  Data is available for 50 years for attributing this credit.26300_30 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	According to common consensus some different hypotheses are suggested for the rise in temperature.26300_31 	A3G5KNQKP3O4KN 	Such a hypothesis is proposed in different forms of the heat may be the result of solar activity26300_33 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	As a consequence of the slow response to the thermal inertia of the thermal inertia of the great oceans of the earth and other invisible influences&#44; the present temperature of the earth is not in balance with the pressure put on it.  It is demonstrated by the studies on the climate commitment that if the greenhouse gases are stabilised at the 200 level&#44; then there is some cushion before the limit.26300_35 	A3G5KNQKP3O4KN 	Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere26300_36 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	Effect of greenhouse was found out by Joseph Phoriyar in year 1824 and for first time quantitative investigation was done by Svante Arrhenius in 189626300_41 	A3M75K5YAV389B 	The increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) content in the atmosphere. The monthly CO2 measure shows that there are small changes in the climate in the entire year. Every year these changes in the Northern Hemisphere increases at the end of the monsoon and decreases during the time of seed plantation as plants absorb some CO@ from the atmosphere.26300_42 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	The existence of the greenhouse effect is not disputed in this way. The natural emission of greenhouse gases means the effect of warming of 33 degree Celsius (59F)&#44; which not suitable for life on earth.26300_43 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	The important greenhouse gases on earth are&#44; water-vapor&#44; which produces 36-70 percent of the greenhouse effect; carbon-dioxide (CO2) which creates 9-26 percent of the greenhouse effect; methane (CH4) 4-9 percent and ozone which creates 3-7 percent of the effect.26300_44 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	The issue is how the strength of the greenhouse effect is transformed when the atmospheric concentration of some greenhouse gases is increased due to human activities.26300_46 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	One of these&#44; nitrous oxide (N2O) is increasing because of human activities like agriculture.26300_47 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	The atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 have increased by 31% and 149% respectively after the beginning of the industrial revolution in the middle of the 17th century. These levels are considered much greater than those at any other time in the past 650000 years.26300_48 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	This is the period for which reliable figures have been determined from ice-cores. It is thought from less direct geological evidence that such great level of CO2 was last present 200 million years ago.26300_49 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	By burning of fossil fuels&#44; human activity of the last 20 years has led to an increment in the rate of increase in CO2 of at least a third.26300_54 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	Annual increase of Carbon dioxide in atomsphere: Average annual increase in 1960 was only 37% of increase between 2000 and 2007.26300_55 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	The present atmospheric concentration of CO2 is about 385 ppm volume wise.26300_56 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	There is chance of increase CO2 concentration in future because there is changing pattern in use of fossil fuel and land. The rate increase will depend upon economical&#44; sociological&#44; technological and natural events but ultimately availability of fossil fuel may be deciding factor. Special report on emission scenario by IPCC tell about CO2 scenario in future which may reach from 541 to 970 ppm by the end of 2100.26300_57 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	To attain this level and to continue emission after 2100 sufficient store of fossil fuel is available&#44; if coal&#44; tar sands or methane clathrate is extensively used.26300_59 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	The effect of obstructive components on climate become complicated through various processes.26300_60 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	One of the most apparent retort is related to evaporation of water.26300_61 	ATA8X60VC3SSB 	The warm atmosphere resulted from the combination of effective greenhouses gases with carbon dioxide&#44; can cause the increase of water level in the sea to flooding.26300_62 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	Because water vapor itself is a green house gas&#44; the atmosphere become more hot&#44; and this leads to further evaporation of water (positive feedback)&#44; and this reaction continue on till positive feedback is not checked. The effect of carbon dioxide alone will be significant.26300_64 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Reversal of the process will be gradual since there is a definite atmospheric lifetime of Carbon dioxide gas.26300_65 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Reversal of the process under the effect of the clouds is a constant process.26300_66 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	From below the cloud layer&#44; it is observed that clouds minimize heat loss from the earth&#44; whereas from above the cloud layer&#44; it is observed that it prevents excess heat from the sun from scorching the earth. The type and height of the clouds in this layer will affect the temperatures below this layer.26300_67 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	It is difficult to show these details in the computer models of atmosphere&#44; because the clouds are very small compared to the empty spaces between the points on the computer bites.26300_69 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	As we go up in the troposphere the temperature gets reduced.26300_70 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The emission temperature of infrared radiation depends on the intensity&#44; from the upper layers of the atmosphere longwave radiation is emitted&#44; and from the lower layers&#44; this is less.  Most of the radiation emitted from the upper layers goes into the space&#44; whereas the radiation from the lower layers enters the atmosphere again and gets absorbed by it.  In this way&#44; the green house effect depends on the rate of decrease of temperature with the height.  If the temperature decrease rate is less green house effect is less and vice versa.  Theories and models both indicate that due to the worming effect&#44; the decrease in temperature as we go up is reduced.  A negative lapse rate feedback is produced and this makes the green house effect weak.  Calculation of the rate of change of temperature with height is very subtle and sensitive to tiny changes&#44; and so it is very difficult to find out whether the model represents the reality or not.26300_71 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Another important process is the Ice Albedo Reversal.26300_72 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	When the temperatures of the earth rise&#44; ice caps at the poles start to melt.26300_74 	A2OCN0KL27QMTP 	Compared to ice&#44; land and water are not easily convertable and therefore can absorb sun rays easily.26300_75 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	This results in more heat and as a consequence more ice gets melted and this cycle continues.26300_76 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	Positive feedback which happens because of emission of CO2 and CH4 is another reason for warming. These gases arise from permafrost from Siberian marshes. In the same way methane clathrate gives rise to heavy amounts of CH4 which can be an important reason for warming as told by clathrate  gun hypothesis.26300_77 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	The capability to separate carbon decreases with the warming of the ocean.26300_84 	A2OCN0KL27QMTP 	some papers suggest that very less research has been done on this.26300_86 	A7N3BRBS77RH1 	Still they believe that despite solar forcing&#44; maximum warming might be due to greenhouse gases&#44; especially since the mid 20th century onwards.26300_87 	A7N3BRBS77RH1 	One assumption is that different forms of solar output that helps in cloud formation&#44;is formed by galactic cosmic ray&#44; also has its share in recent warming. This is also suggested that sun&#39;s magnetic activity also unleashes cosmic rays that affects the condensation nucleus of clouds and climate is also affected.26300_88 	A7N3BRBS77RH1 	One of the influence of sun&#39;s activity would be that stratosphere would become warm&#44; whereas greenhouse gas theory forecasts it to become cold. Post 1960&#44; this trend has been observed that stratosphere has only become cold.Reduction of stratospheric ozone leads to coolness&#44; but ozone depletion did not happen till the decade of 1970. Due to solar variation and volcanic activities from industrial age till 1950&#44; it did not become hot but has become cooler only. In 2006&#44; Peter Foukal and other astrophysicists from USA&#44; Germany and Switzerland found that in the last 1000 years there has been no net increase in sun&#39;s brightness. Due to solar cycle&#44; in the last 30 years there is increase of only 0.07 %. For global warming effect this is a small but important contribution.26300_89 	A7N3BRBS77RH1 	A research by Mike Lockwood and Klaus Froehlich found that from 1985 till now&#44; there is no relation between global warming and solar radiation&#44; either that is about solar energy or cosmic ray. Henrik Svensmark and Eigil Friis-Christensen&#44; who are the founder of cloud formation&#44; has commented on their assumption. In 2007 it was found from one research that in last 20 years cosmic rays coming to earth and clouds and climate has no relation.26300_94 	A7N3BRBS77RH1 	Temperature of two centuries is viewed in different method&#44; in every method a decade was made a scale. Annual census of 2004 has been registered for reference.26300_96 	A7N3BRBS77RH1 	As per instrumental temperature record earth&#39;s temperature&#44; either on land or in sea has increased as compared to 1830-1900. This increase in temperature is not due to the urban heat island effect.From 1079 land&#39;s temperature has increased twofold as compared to that of sea (0.25 degree Celsius per century versus 0.13 degree Celsius per century)26300_97 	A7N3BRBS77RH1 	In lower troposphere temperature has increased between 0.12 and 0.22 degree Celsius (0.22 and 0.4 degree F) per decade&#44; as per the satellite temperature measurements. It is believed that one or two thousand years prior to 1950 temperature has comparatively been stable other than some regional ups and down like medieval warm period or little Ice age.26300_99 	A3NMRXYNBNFNUT 	Based on the estimates of NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies&#44; 2005 was the warmest year ever recorded since the advent of temperature measuring equipments by the end of the year 1800. The previous record&#44; measured in the year 1998&#44; was broken by 1/100th of a degree.2646_101 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	If&#44; zone&#44; distance connection: mobile phone&#39;s global history&#44; 2004 ISBN 1-84046-541-72646_102 	A1ESKJFDQUMBL4 	Ahonen&#44;Tommi&#44;m-gain:make money with 3G service&#44;2002&#44;ISBN 0-470-84775-12646_103 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	Ahonen&#44; Casper and Melco&#44; 3G marketing 2004&#44; ISBN 0-47085100-72646_104 	A2NVTQQZ6P8Q49 	Lotus&#44; peter and bartshach Stephen &#44;aids.finger culture: meaning for the mobile phone for the sake of society.2646_106 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	Kaburi&#44; Aanandam &amp; Aakraneox&#44; Noah&#44; adds reader on cell phone: essay on social change&#44; 20062646_107 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	Kopoma&#44; Timor.

From motor vehicles and industry: carbon monoxide&#44; chlorofluorocarbon and nitrogen oxide are common pollutants. Photochemical ozone and smog are formed by a process involving nitrogen oxide&#44; hydrocarbon and sunlight.28539_33 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	On the surface of rivers and groundwater runoff system&#44; wastewater and pollution containing water are responsible for water pollution.28539_34 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	Soil contamination happens when chemicals mix with soil during sprays and underground chemical reactions. Most important among soil contaminant are heavy metals&#44; hydrocarbons&#44; MTBE&#44; herbicides&#44; pesticides and chlorinated hydrocarbons.28539_36 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	Noise pollution includes roadway noise&#44; aircraft noise&#44; industrial noise and high frequency sonar.28539_37 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	In light pollution are included overuse of light&#44; over illumination&#44; and astronomical interference.28539_38 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	Visual pollution includes power lines&#44; motorway billboards&#44; landforms&#44; strip mining and municipal waste.28539_39 	AA4XJ5YP5SLN2 	Themal polution is due to excessive evaporation of water near rivers/ seas and due to human activities like use of water as coolent in nuclear plants28539_42 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	Emission from motor vehicles is the main cause of air pollution. China&#44; United States of America&#44; Russia&#44; Mexico and Japan are world leaders in emission&#44; however&#44; Canada holds the second position on the per capita serial order.28539_43 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The main fixed sources of pollution are chemical plants&#44; coal based power plants&#44; oil refineries&#44; petrochemical industries&#44; settlements of nuclear wastes&#44; incinerators&#44; big animal farms (dairy cows&#44; pigs&#44; hatcheries&#44; etc.) PVC factories&#44; minerals producing indutries&#44; plastic industries and other heavy industries.28539_44 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Other common soil pollutants are chlorinated hydrocarbons&#44; heavy metals (like Chromium&#44; Cadmium -- which comes from reusable batteries&#44; and lead -- from paints&#44; aviation fuel&#44; and in some countries&#44; gasoline&#44; MTBE&#44; Zinc&#44; Arsenic)&#44; and Benzene.  In 2001&#44; the press reports were compiled and published as a book by the title &quot;Fateful Harvest&quot;&#44; in which are given the extents of soil pollution caused by different minerals&#44; and recyclable byproducts of industries.  City administrations are the sources of landfills with such wastes.  Many chemicals enter the soil and affect the fertility of the land&#44; particularly the unscientific disposal of intoxicating drugs&#44; or pre -1970 landfills which were then filled in European Union and America under minimal controls.  For example&#44; there are many unnatural consequences of a common chemical called plychlorinated dibenzodioxins&#44; commonly called TCDD.28539_46 	A1EJBHL6NE2FYF 	In the category of noise pollution the main sources of creating noise pollution are motor vehicle&#44; which accounts for the 10% of the world noise pollution28539_49 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	Harmful air quality can kill many living species in addition to human being. Ozone pollution may cause respiratory disease&#44; cardiac disease&#44; burning throat&#44; pain in chest and suffocation.On an average about 14&#44;000 people die daily due to pollution of untreated sewage water drinking in developing countries.  Oil sprinkle may cause burning and rashes to skin. Noise pollution leads to hearing loss&#44; high blood pressure and sleep disturbance.28539_51 	A1E27YTR0AV5GB 	sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide can result in acid rain which decreases the pH of soil.28539_52 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Land can become arid and useless for plantation&#44; and this influences the food web of other living organisms.28539_53 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	Smog and haze may lower photosynthesis by plant performed with the help of sun light.28539_54 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Invasive species can drive out native species because of competition and this can lead to reduction in biodiversity.  Invasive species produce allelopathic bio cells which can harm the atmospheric chemical balance and sometimes drive away the basic species also by competition.28539_57 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Many countries are making rules  regarding obedience and many  natural methods  to protect the nature along with the environment28539_61 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	The 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference took place at the Bali International Conference Centre&#44; Nusa Dua&#44; in Bali&#44; Indonesia&#44; between December 3 and December 15&#44; 2007 (though originally planned to end on 14 December).[1] Representatives from over 180 countries attended&#44; together with observers from intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations.[2] The conference encompassed meetings of several bodies&#44; including the 13th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 13)&#44; the 3rd Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP 3 or CMP 3)&#44; together with other subsidiary bodies and a meeting of ministers28539_63 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	The environment in China has traditionally been neglected as the country concentrates on its rise as an economic power. Despite a recent interest in environmental reform&#44; pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in 30 cities and 78 counties&#44; the Ministry of Health says.[1] Only 1 percent of the countrys 560 million city inhabitants (2007) breathe air deemed safe by the European Union. Chinese industry scores very poorly in energy efficiency. Chinese steel factories use one-fifth more energy per ton than the international average.

To get into this position naturally&#44; the man lies on his back.  Then bringing the cunt above the prick&#44; the woman strightens her feet till the knees on the bed&#44; and then&#44; strightening the thighs above the knees makes the prick enter into her cunt.

In this the man lies down on his back. During this he can raise his shoulders/head region with the help of a pillow. Now the woman should sit facing him.

During this her legs are a little bent at the knees&#44; which help her move up and down. Though in this position the woman&#39;s arms upon bearing the force feel a little tired affecting the speed of coitus&#44; but this sex position becomes explosive and ecstatic when the woman is stiff with strong muscle power.45708_48 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	In this position the woman is better facing the man. This position allows much more closeness and is good for those couples who are more interested in kissing during the foreplay. In this position the man sits on a bed or in a similar place with his legs lowered to the ground. The woman  while facing the man then takes the vagina over the man&#39;s penis and spreads her legs. The woman&#39;s hands also take support on the man&#39;s body. In this position the man&#44; During the foreplay&#44; either can bring his hands backwards to take support or can also put them on the woman&#39;s buttocks or the waist to increase the intensity and speed of his strokes. Unfortunately&#44; the position shown in the picture is not as much effective for strokes (as shown in the ratings). Use a stool or a chair to enjoy this position to the fullest. In this the woman has ample opportunities to rest her legs. One can also sit conveniently to enjoy the position even more.45708_50 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	Hand: The couple can use their hands to stroke stimulating parts of the partner with their hands since they are empty.45708_54 	A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST 	Joyful: This is similar to the butterfly position.

To achieve this position the man lies straight on his back and woman comes on top of him and inserts his penis into her vagina from the top. This position facilitates kissing of the cheeks&#44; neck and breasts of the woman.45708_65 	A370556EFVZ9W4 	We cannot undestand classical music unless and until we hear it and try to understand the quality and beauty of its components. The same is the case of a sex position when a man is on top. This is that time when one needs to make the classic position more elegant and find out why it is a classic position. Another thing that needs to be understood is that when the man is on top&#44; it does not have to mean that the woman is going to experience idle and powerful sexual gerations. Nor these positions can be called the boring positions of the past just the way some people think about the positions that involve men on top. By making some small changes these positions can be made elegant. In all this positions effort needs to be made by the man. Before any inital position it is better to talk to your partner. If there is any kind of communication gap&#44; then no position would be comfortable for both the partners. This means that every woman wants that her mate has such size and shape that can push her to the limits of sexual excitement and for this there is a need for a great position that has been discussed and decided according to her needs and which pushes her to the limit of sexual climax. If they are successful in doing this just once&#44; they can repeat whenever they want to reach the limits of sexual excitement. One thing that needs to be told is that most men choose men on top position so that they can reach an orgasm. This is why the men on top position is a powerful position. But is in this position is the man is fast and powerful from the begining then it may lead to loss of feeling and stamina at the end. This position is very good for those who are relatively new to sex&#44; but when excitement is taken into consideration this position is good for everyone. This is why it is necessary that the women tell their partner to stay in control and try to experiment and determine which position is good for satisfcation of both their needs.45708_68 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	Evaluation-   Convenience to Woman (Receiver)  Inconvenience to Woman (Receiver)  Joy to Woman (Receiver)45708_69 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	Convenience to Man (Giver)  Inconvenience to Man (Giver)  Joy to Man (Giver)45708_70 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	Intimacy   Depth of Penetration   Mobility of Penetration45708_71 	A3M75K5YAV389B 	Hand lift: In this the woman uses her parter&#39;s hand with her own hand to make the position comfortable.

Radon (Rn) gas is a carcinogen&#44; which comes out of the earth at some places and spreads in the houses.  Formaldehyde (H2CO) gas is emitted from building materials like carpets and plywood.  While dryinig&#44; paints and solvents emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  Lead based paint can turn into dust and can go inside the body through breathing.  Deliberate air pollution is caused by air fresheners&#44; incense and other scented materials.  Smoke from the stoves in which wood is burnt in a controlled manner&#44; and from the fireplaces&#44; can add in considerable quantities to the inner and outer air&#44; the effect of smoking.

England sufered the highest during the Great Smog of 1952&#44; which occurred on 4 December 1952 in London.More than 4000 people died in six days&#44; and 8000 others dies in the next few months.In 1979&#44; near Sverdlovsk in the USSR&#44; hundreds died due to a biological warfare of Anthrax.The worst disaster of the United States can be the one in Donora&#44; Pennsylvania&#44; in the last days of October&#44; when 20 died and 7000 were injured.50557_74 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Ailments caused due to air pollutants include respiratory diseases&#44; hoarseness in throat&#44; cough and breathing difficulty and heart ailments. These ailments cause crowds to throng dispensaries and hospitals&#44; and the rise in usage of medicines. They result in untimely deaths. Harm caused due to air pollutants has long-term effects&#44; but it reflects immediately through heart ailments and breathing ailments.The method that air pollutants act on a persons body depends on which pollutants he is subjected to&#44; to what duration&#44; his own level of health and hereditary factors.50557_76 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	According to a research done in the University of Washington&#44; people residing in polluted areas are likely to get respiratory diseases.

The people who took part in this research resided near an Environmental Protection Agency. During the research&#44; 117 died due to air pollution.It was observed that the diseased population staying in urban areas are likely to get medical help faster. Those who were ailing from Cystic Fibrosis are affected more from car pollutants&#44; tobacco and smoking and from internal heating devices&#44;since their lungs are already harmed from the disease.50557_78 	A3IHCT015XNNJK 	disease of constant blockage in lungs (Chronic obstructive pulmonary diesease)(COPD) includes chonic bronchitis&#44; emphysema and certain disease like asthma.

There was no restriction on the number of members of the Council of Ministers in the original constitution but with 91st Amendment the number of members of the Council of Ministers has been limited to 15% of the number of Members of Parliament whereas in the states the number of members of the Council of Ministers has been limited to maximum 15% of the number of Members of Legislative Assembly but there should be at least 12 ministers.19296_128 	A3GTXOXRSE74WD 	Categories of ministers are decided according to English laws not by the Indian constitution.19296_129 	A3GTXOXRSE74WD 	There are three type of ministers.19296_130 	A3GTXOXRSE74WD 	1.Cabinet ministers- Seniormost ministers in hierarchy.They form the cabinet.They head the ministry assigned to them.They are helped by state ministers and deputy ministers.They attend cabinet meetings. Article 352 gives them official recognition.19296_131 	A3GTXOXRSE74WD 	Please attach the list of all cabinet ministries and state ministries separately.19296_133 	A9H4GEUPLSQ3M 	deputy minister is the junior most minister  his post is created to help the cabinet or state minister they do not take independent charge of the ministries and departments.19296_134 	A9H4GEUPLSQ3M 	parliamentary secretary is the member of parliament from the ruling party after his appointment he helps the council of ministers and its committees he assumes his office on the sweet will of the prime minister and also takes an oath of secrecy through him in reality the secretary is not member of the council of ministers but only holds a grade of a minister.19296_136 	A9H4GEUPLSQ3M 	the council of ministers is a united forum consisting of 1 2 or 3 types of ministers it meets discusses or decides a very few times whereas the council consists of only cabinet level ministers which meets at specified times and takes all important decisions such decisions are accepted and deemed to be passed by the council this is the most important decision taking forum of the country19296_138 	A9H4GEUPLSQ3M 	according to article 75(2) the ministers are individually responsible to the president but the president cannot remove any minister if it is not suggested by the prime minister.19296_140 	A9H4GEUPLSQ3M 	the attorney general of India can participate in any house of the parliament without being member of any house.19296_143 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Annexure 74 considers it compulsory for the Prime Minister to preside over and manage the cabinet.In case of his resignation or death&#44; the cabinet is considered to be dissolved. The rime Minister holds the ultimate power to appoint the cabinet&#44; The President appoints the cabinet according to the say of teh Prime Minister. He solely decides the portfolios of the ministers. He gives orders to all government institutions and the final decisions also rest with him.He is the central figure between the President and the cabinet of ministers. He is the speaker and leads debates and discussions. He can debate any topic raised in the parliament. He can check the work of any ministry. These are the reasons why he is considered the most important political figure in the country.19296_144 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Types of Government headed by a Prime Minister.19296_145 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Government of a Prime Minister is same as that of a parliamentary government. The Prime minister heads the Cabinet of ministers&#44; and affects all decisions made therein. His decision is taken as the decision of the whole cabinet. The Prime minster can take decisions and work in association with the cabinet&#44; or with any of his colleagues&#44; even if he is not part of the cabinet. For example&#44; Indira Gandhi took aid from her kitchen cabinet.19296_146 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Advantages of the prime ministerial type of government.19296_148 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	2. The country gets political stability.19296_149 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	There are some disadvantages too19296_150 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	1. Cabinet can also take decisions which are not of benefit to its party or the country in general.19296_151 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	2. This leads to powers going into wrong hands.19296_153 	A10X8YVBG51O98 	The parliament cannot take decisions on its own. It needs the approval of the prime minister before any decision is taken. This way &#44; the powers of the parliament are checked upon by the Prime Minister.19296_154 	A1NKIYEHUEU6NE 	Since 1989&#44; the country has not been ruled by the Prime-ministerial form of Government&#44; rather the country has been ruled by the Cabinet form of Government.19296_155 	A1NKIYEHUEU6NE 	The Duties of the Prime Minister19296_156 	A10X8YVBG51O98 	1- The regulation of the parliament19296_160 	A10X8YVBG51O98 	5- He is responsible for country&#39;s foreign affairs19296_163 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	This government is interim in nature. It is established till new ministers committee does not take the oath. It works to comply with the schedule 74 that a cabinet of ministers is always there to help President.19296_164 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	V.N. Raav in Supreme court accepted that this government should be always present because in there absence President will work self by which the government will become presidential which is against the basic outline of the constitution.19296_165 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	This interim government cannot take any decisions on policy and economy because public assembly is not present at that time. It runs everday administration of the country.19296_166 	A3ELVO76HX7X55 	The most critical moment was at the time when Atal bihari Vajpayee&#39;s government had to calarify the Kargil war in 199919296_169 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	In a democratic government these traditions are such practices which are considered on every part of government by law. Their description is not given in the constitution of any country because constitution committee was not able to account for the development and administration of the country in the future. So they were not able to manage for them in the constitution.19296_170 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	In this way constitution is like a living body but with no description. No changes can be made in the description without any amendments. These traditions are not lawful like the others in the constitution. They help in the effective administration of the government.19296_171 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	Traditions are followed because without them political difficulties can arise. That is why they complete the meaningfulness of the constitution. We can see the most developed and effective form of them in Britain.19296_173 	A1ESKJFDQUMBL4 	Secondly this is related to working of parliament&#44; like three time reading of any bill&#44; giving the permission to financial bill in three sessions of parliament&#44; selection of sub speaker from opposition party when speaker is elected from power party etc.19296_174 	A3M58JENI5651B 	The Parliamentarian and Constitutional form of Government.19296_175 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	Arguments supporting the parliamentary form of government19296_176 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	1. In the presidential form of government the president is the true executive who is elected by the people for a fixed period of time. He is not even accountable to the legislature. His ministers are also not members of the legislature and will be accountable only to him and not to the legislature.19296_178 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Keeping in mind the diversity of India&#44; the constitutional rule is better since people from all classes form part of the parliament.19296_179 	A3M58JENI5651B 	There is less possibility of clashes between the Legislative Body and the Council of Ministers&#44; because all ministers are the members of  Legislation Body.19296_180 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	It is almost impossible to elect a President according to the wishes of a majority of citizens&#44; since India has a very diverse population.19296_181 	A3M58JENI5651B 	5  Indian people have been familiar with the Parliamentarian rule from the time of &quot;Marle-Minto Reforms 1909&quot;.19296_184 	A1NKIYEHUEU6NE 	It is a house which is a provider of representation to the states on the federal level; the functioning of which is to protect the interests of the states at the federal level.19296_185 	A1NKIYEHUEU6NE 	It is called the second house of the parliament and its members are elected through two methods. From the states 238 members are elected and 12 are nominated by the President.19296_186 	A1NKIYEHUEU6NE 	Presently this number is 233 and 12 respectively. These members are elected for six years. They are elected through the proportional representative system and the voting is done through unitary transferable vote.19296_188 	A115PREVPO3IK7 	The special powers of Council of States19296_189 	A115PREVPO3IK7 	Council of States has three special powers19296_190 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	Under article 249 it has power with respect to a matter in the State List in the national interest to pass a bill for one year.19296_191 	AKQNWRMKJZMJA 	If Rajya Sabha passes a resolution by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting declaring that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest to create one or more All India Services common to the Union and the States&#44; Parliament becomes empowered to create by law such services.19296_193 	A12J6U15W1MWZ 	Rajya Sabha&#39;s (Upper House) federal form19296_194 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	Rajyasabha was formed for the state seminar and to have representative for the constitutional formation.19296_195 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	The members of the rajyasabha can become member of ministry and are allowed to represent and take decision on the behalf of the state.19296_196 	A12J6U15W1MWZ 	The election of Vice President is same as the election or impeachment of President.19296_198 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	All the new constitunal bills are reviewed and thereby with a majority of 2/3 are passed.19296_199 	AGUEWXL636ANK 	The bills requiring the approval of the senate alongwith the ones of emergencies need be reviewed in rajyasabha19296_200 	A1E27YTR0AV5GB 	Rajya sabha s importance in union territory19296_201 	A12J6U15W1MWZ 	Federal areas also get representation in Rajya Sabha for that have only federal appearance19296_203 	AA4XJ5YP5SLN2 	In Rajya sabha there is a provision of nominating members19296_205 	A2HYN509OGM53T 	In federal rule due to constitutional obligation the upper part of federal legislature has been made to safe guard the states welfare at federal level&#44; based on this principle Rajyashabha was constituted. Due to this reason the Rajyashabha is seen on equal level of houses&#44; Constitution of which is done as the second house of Parliament.19296_206 	A2HYN509OGM53T 	This is the demand of republic where Lakshabha is elected directly by the public&#44; have used the special power&#44; as per the principle of democracy makes cabinet also answerable to the Lokshabha but both these reasons does not lessen the importance of Rajyashabha in any way.19296_208 	A2HYN509OGM53T 	All the proposal which comes before President regarding the imposition of emergency&#44; should also be passed by the Rajyashabha.19296_209 	AA4XJ5YP5SLN2 	Importance of rajya sabha is to implement the law and directives of democracy without any partiality19296_210 	A1ESKJFDQUMBL4 	It put the only moral effect on governance but this is a more as compare to parliament19296_211 	AA4XJ5YP5SLN2 	The Officals of Rajya sabha decides the size&#44; work&#44; strength&#44; designations and responsibilities of their members19296_213 	A28FIZSLCZ96NM 	This is Parliament&#39;s popular house where elected and nominated members are there.

Next time Parliament members strength will be decided in the year 2026. At present it is based on population as on 1971. Before this member seats were decided on the basis of every ten yearly census. This task was carried out in accordance with 84th constitutional amendment so that states on the basis of their population don&#39;t try to occupy more seats.19296_216 	A28FIZSLCZ96NM 	The Lok Sabha is formed for a five-year term but it can be dissolved earlier as well.19296_218 	A28FIZSLCZ96NM 	Council of minister is responsible only to the Lok Sabha.

Their aim is to provide cheap and fast justice to common man and make the judiciary system work according to the constitution.19296_380 	A2CSX5G96MCRHK 	The misuse of law in social interest or personal interest is punishable.

These can be brought up with the Government even against its own institutions19296_387 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	1. Because of this petition / writ&#44; awareness of the public about their own rights and about the role of judiciary increases&#44; this makes the area of fundamental rights very strong&#44; the individual gets many new rights19296_390 	A6UOPDHGI9D8D 	1.This creates a problem in the maintenance of common law and order.19296_391 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	2. There is a possibility of its misuse19296_392 	A6UOPDHGI9D8D 	Because of this&#44; the supreme court has restricted their   use.19296_394 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The meaning of judicial activity is the active role played by the judiciary which directs the other parts of the State to discharge their constitutional duties.  If those other parts of the state satisfactorily discharge their work&#44; the period for which the judiciary takes over for a limited period only&#44; their role and democratic and administrative powers.  This activity restores the power of democracy and people&#39;s faith.19296_395 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Thus&#44; this activity is a burden loaded on the judiciary because of the insensible and irresponsible deeds of the Government.  This activity is a judicial effort made under compulsion.  This power is only with the High Courts and the Supreme Court.  Their review and return are under the powers of the Government.  We can consider writ in public interest as the as the main medium of judicial activity.19296_396 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	It can be supported only to a limited extent. Its opposition can also be heard by the administration and Government.

He is appointed by the President and can be removed any time by The President.19296_405 	A12T8G7H6WN13A 	His position and role has been controversial for several years and there ha bee a lot of discussion on this. A Governmental report has the following recommendation on this matter.19296_406 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	1. The President should appoint the Governor only after consultation with the Chief Minister.19296_407 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	2.He should be an important achiever in any field.19296_409 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	4. Politically he should not have been active in the country for at least 5 years in the past&#44;  and should never have been active in the state where he is being posted.19296_410 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	5. Normally he should be allowed to complete five years of tenure so that he can work impartially19296_411 	ADOXDQPX17PHN 	A candidate who has political coalition should not be made State Governor as he might be ruled by the opposite party.19296_412 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	7. The custom of sending indepent reports through the Governor should be continued19296_414 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Apart from this&#44; the Governor is a constitutional head who aids the cabinet ministers.But his post is fairly more secure than that of the cabinet.He is not merely a &quot;presiding person like the President&#44; who has a power but can be influenced by the conditions prevailing. A governor has the power and the influence&#44; which makes his post an attractive as well as active work.19296_415 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	The Governor uses the power  which is similar to that of the President&#44; and he also has some extra powers which he can exercise at any time he feels.19296_416 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	According to Article 166 (2)&#44; if there is any question regarding the powers of the Governor&#44; he himself is the ultimate decisive person.19296_417 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	According to Article 166(3)&#44; the Governor can constructively exercise the powers to facilitate smooth running of the administration of the state and he can also allocate portfolios to the ministers.19296_419 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	According to Article 356&#44;A Governor can invite a ban on the powers of the President if he feels that he has acted against the principles of the Constitution.19296_421 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Traditionally&#44; the Governor can decide on the fortnightly report to the President.19296_422 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	In some states&#44; there are additinal responsibilties given to the Governor. He can receive suggestions from the ministers but is not bound to accept them&#44; and he is not bound to offer them suggestions of any kind.19296_424 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	The Constitution has allowed 6 states to have a dual house of ruling.19296_425 	A2HYN509OGM53T 	Establishing and uprooting of Upper House&#44; as per article 169 this power is only with the Parliament.19296_426 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	Significance of upper house - This house is not of first class&#44; it can not reject or revise a bill passed by legislative assembly it can only delay for a maximum period of 4 month. In addition it can be used for appointment of specialist in the cabinet because there is provision of nominated member also.19296_427 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	The activities of the Upper House are threefold- Wealth&#44; Finance and common. Wealth bills are passed as they are in the central government. Finance bills are put forth only in the Lower house. Common / ordinary bills are put forth in the Upper House&#44; but even if it is passed there&#44; it can be rejected by the Lower House.19296_430 	A2HYN509OGM53T 	There are three types of benches in State Judiciary19296_431 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	One way&#44; in which their verdicts can be challenged in the Divisional/ Khandpith or in the Supreme Court.19296_432 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Divisional bench consists of 2 or 3 judges&#44; whose verdict can be challenged only in the Supreme Court.19296_435 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Civil Crimal cases are given an individual hearing. Civil and Session Courts are different bodies. Judges at this level are appointed through common examinations&#44; and they are appointed by the Governor and the High Court Judge.19296_436 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Fast track courts- These are special courts which have been started with a purpose to quickly proceed with long pending criminal cases or under-trial disputes.19296_437 	A3PWE6Y56BRAT9 	These are additional session courts.The are formed for speedy disposal of long pending crime and under trial cases.The reason behind is that long cases are a loss to justice and the  breaking power of justice becomes weak and jails become crowded.On the advise of finance commission the central government has instructed state governments to set up 1734 fast track courts with effect from 01 April 2001.Additional session judges or judges retired from higher positions are appointed as judges in such courts.In this kind of courts&#44; it is not possible to make a trial pending.All trials are to be decided within a stipulated time period.19296_440 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	2.Verdict is in a summary form. There is little time for the parties to have a detailed discussion.19296_441 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	3. There are no laws regarding the work of the lawyers.19296_442 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Peoples court-are different than the regular courts.A retired judge and two workers&#44; out of which one is a social worker and the other is a lawyer&#44; are members of this court.Hearings take place only when both parties are ready. These courts deal with insurance disputes too.19296_444 	A1ZYNAB4UPQ1UF 	The advantages of these: 1. No court fees are applicable.19296_445 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	2. Here procedural codes/evidences acts are not applicable.19296_446 	A1ZYNAB4UPQ1UF 	3. Both parties come to agrement by direct discussions with the Judge.19296_447 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	4.

According to ayurveda&#44; these three regulatory principles Doshas (literally that which deteriorates ) are important for health&#44; because when they are in a more balanced state&#44; the body will function to its fullest&#44; and when imbalanced&#44; the body will be affected negatively in certain ways.193079_19 	A10X8YVBG51O98 	Hinduism and Buddhism have been an influence on the development of many of ayurveda&#39;s central ideas  particularly its fascination with balance.193079_21 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	There is a descriptive discussion about them in Ayurveda.193079_22 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	Here only a brief introduction has been given.193079_23 	A3IQM17WUKCBSY 	but before this an introduction of every component of age is important&#44; because without the knowledge of the components it would not be possible to know the defects occurring in them.193079_26 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	Six basic parts of human body are: two hands&#44; two legs&#44; head and neck as one and the whole middle part.193079_27 	AA4XJ5YP5SLN2 	These main organs have sub organs like eyess&#44; ear&#44; nose&#44; eyelids&#44; forhead&#44; checks&#44; neck&#44; mouth&#44; back&#44; chest&#44; tits&#44; stomach&#44; penis&#44; buttock&#44; thigs&#44; fingers&#44; feet&#44;etc193079_28 	AA4XJ5YP5SLN2 	Internal organs are brain&#44; heart&#44; lungs&#44; kidney&#44; intestine&#44; gal bladder&#44; uniral bladder&#44; lever&#44; small intertine&#44; rectum. head is the owner of these organs which acts as per direction from head193079_29 	A2GGFBEGFXJFRS 	According to Ayurveda there are 300 bones in our body but on the basis of counting they are considered only 206 nowadays and 200 joints&#44; 900 ligaments&#44; 700 blood vessels&#44; 24 cranial nerves and their 200 branches&#44; 500 muscles( 20 more in females) and minute sources are 30&#44;146.193079_31 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Generally&#44; it gets depleted daily due to its use in different activities&#44; but the different foods that we ingest result in replinishing it and also increases the mineral content.193079_32 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	The dietary substance that is ingested passes through the various organs and is transformed into a form of a mineral that is needed by the body.193079_33 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	During digestion&#44; the extract of the dietary substances nourish the fluids(blood) in the body&#44; and the remaining substances form faeces and urine.193079_34 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Blood passes through the heart  and blood vessels to every cell in the body and nourishes them.193079_36 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	There are no waste substances in Shukra.

But&#44; correct ethics and other conditions make the other two qualities equally strong.193079_72 	A3ELVO76HX7X55 	That&#39;s the reason an open mind has to be kept pure and true away from negative and gloomy thoughts.193079_73 	A3ELVO76HX7X55 	looking deep inside the soul and the sub concious mind you can come to know of your deepest desires according to which the body behaves.193079_74 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The soul makes the senses and bodily organs perform through the mind only&#44; as the mind is its instrument.193079_75 	AOG9H27586IOW 	That is why mind when it interacts with one sense organ&#44; information is gained from it&#44; not from others.193079_77 	A3ELVO76HX7X55 	Still the speed of the mind is so much that it can go from one place to the other in a split second&#44; by which we only know that it is in touch with everything&#44; and all tasks are being done at one time however in reality that is not the fact.193079_79 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Soul is different from the five great life elements and the mind&#44; it is conscious&#44; shapeless&#44; decay-less and permanent and also an observer-like&#44; because it is by itself shapeless and activityless.193079_80 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	By its contact&#44; consciousness starts flowing in the active but unconscious mind&#44; organs and body&#44; and they become work-oriented.193079_82 	A1NKIYEHUEU6NE 	Feelings of desire&#44; malice&#44; pleasure&#44; pain&#44; efforts&#44; patience&#44; wisdom&#44; memory power&#44; proud&#44; etc. have their existence only when there is soul in the body; they do not exist in a dead body where there is no soul.193079_83 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	These are all factors that prove the existence of the soul in the body&#44; and are&#44; in fact&#44; said to be the indications from which the soul can be experienced.193079_84 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	There are no ways to know a persons soul by any other sense than mere imagination.193079_85 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	This soul is everlasting&#44; unaffected and encompasses everything in the universe.It performs good or bad deeds only when it merges into a mind and physical body.193079_87 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	From this discussion&#44; it is clear that the soul is unaffected by any factor&#44; but the body&#44; mind and senses can develop an illness. An ailment in any one of the three can be transmitted to any of the others.193079_88 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	Therefore it is vital to keep them healthy or to bring them to normal or make them healthy if they are diseased.193079_89 	A1O9BHBJKVI5PS 	By this happiness and a long-life are obtained&#44; following which the soul is helped in becoming liberated of its sole but grueling disease in the form of birth&#44; death and emotional ties&#44; which is termed &quot;Naitishthaki&quot; treatment in Ayurveda.193079_92 	A21CDLZGS75IFQ 	Sushruta said that the characteristics of a healthy person are as follows:  every problem is in limited stage&#44;that means everything in a normal position&#44; and everything functions including digestion is normal. also whose body and soul is peaceful&#44;whose heart and mind are pure that person is called a healthy person.193079_93 	A21CDLZGS75IFQ 	The riverse side of these characters is called unhealthy.193079_94 	A5L716F3F5R7V 	Disease are called as alteration or disorder.193079_95 	A21CDLZGS75IFQ 	So the unnatural functions of a body &#44;mind and senses of a person is called a decease.193079_97 	A5L716F3F5R7V 	All the things of world is effect on directly or genetically on body&#44;conciousness&#44;mood and disease is the cause of defect arise by the wrong or against effects.193079_98 	A21CDLZGS75IFQ 	It is difficult to explain all these things in detail.We can classify them in three categories.193079_99 	A21CDLZGS75IFQ 	1.Lack of performance: Ignorance&#44;cowardness&#44;memory loss&#44; or intake of any unwanted thing.194789_11 	AA4XJ5YP5SLN2 	The last part of Vedas are known as Upanishadas194789_12 	A3R0SD14UE0QQW 	The specialty of human life is the mental power.

This phenomenon is regarded to be the actual cause of the average global temperature drop during the mid of the 20th century.26300_102 	A3NMRXYNBNFNUT 	However&#44; temperature can also drop due to natural cyclic changes.26300_104 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Paleoclimatologist William Ruddiman has stated that the influence of man on the environment started 8000 years back when man destroyed forests in order to create land for agriculture&#44; and the farming of Asian rice 5000 years ago added to this effect.26300_105 	A3NMRXYNBNFNUT 	The comparisons of methane content&#44; presented in Ruddiman&#39;s historical records is disputed.26300_106 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Variations of climate before the origin of man26300_110 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Two locations in Antarctica have recorded day-to day differences in glacial ice of the world in the form of graphs.26300_112 	A1ESKJFDQUMBL4 	Currently Antarctic EPICA ice core keeps account of 800&#44;000&#44;  years. In which&#44; it is given by 8 interglacial orbital variations&#44; which is used to compare with current temperature.26300_113 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	In the early Jurassic period(around 180 years ago)temperatures increased 5 degrees on an average&#44; due to increase in the greenhouse gases released. Researches in the Open University states that weathering of mountains is related to global warming&#44; and increase it by 40%. This free carbon is bound in a calcite or  dolomite. The level of carbon dioxide came to the average in the next 150000 years.26300_119 	A1ESKJFDQUMBL4 	Temperature of surface during the 21th century.26300_121 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Through HadCM3 climate model&#44; the geographical distribution is mapped&#44; whereas in common scenario&#44; any industrial economic development is considered as the reason for emission of greenhouse gases.  In these data&#44; global level warming adds up to 3.0 degrees C (5.4 degrees F)26300_122 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Scientists have studied global warming by studying emissions in computer models.26300_123 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	These models study the transformations in materials&#44; their radiative transfer&#44; and state the facts in a comprehensive and easy way.The reason is that the capabilities of a computer are limited and the measurements are complex.There are different models like the environmental model&#44; the oceanic model&#44; the ice models(that on earth and on water i.e. icebergs) and all these models are linked together. Some models are also used for studying the chemical and biological changes and see the effect of emission of greenhouse gases on them. Climate sensitivity of different factors is studied and measured.26300_125 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Currrent atmospheric models can cohort well with surveys but cannot make designs of all the finer points.26300_126 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The models on the global warming effect could not differentiate between natural changes and man&#39;s influences during the period from 1910 to 1945.  Even so&#44; they do suggest that after 1975 the observed warming is because of the emission of the green house gases only.26300_127 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	World atmosphere model&#39;s assumtions get influenced by those panoramas of green house gases shown in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) of IPCC&#44; even if they are not naturally occurring.  In this model the carbon cycle is simulated also&#44; and points to constructive ways of responding.  Even if the responses are as yet undecided (In A2 SRES panoramas&#44; there is a difference of 20 and 200 ppm of CO2 between the different responses)&#44; from some monitoring studies&#44; one constructive response is found.26300_128 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	In May 20008&#44; the forecast was made that &quot;World temperature will not increase in the next decade&#44; because the water vapor produced from the Northern Atlantic and the peaceful tropical regions will reduce in an unstable level the anthropogenic warming&quot;.  This forecast was based on the estimates of the temperatures of the oceans.26300_130 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Through a recent study&#44; David Douglass&#44; John Christy&#44; Biniamen Pearson and Fred Singer have shown that if we consider&#44; along with the actual atmospheric model&#44; another 22 prominent global atmospheric models&#44; it is not dependent only on the changes in the troposphers.  The writers argue that these changes do not explain and cohort with the changes in the radiations.26300_135 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Occassional records also show that from the beginning of 1800s&#44; the glaciers are slowly retreating and in 1950&#44; estimation of the ice in the glaciers began and the report is submitted to WGMS and NSIDC.26300_136 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Even though it is difficult to relate the special events of the seasons with the global warming&#44; some of the changes that can be attributed to the increase in global temperature are glacial retreat&#44; Arctic shrinkage and sea level rise.  The changes in the levels of precipitation can lead to droughts and floods.  Extreme weather is also a possible result.26300_138 	A2FDXVWVI05XA4 	It is being considered that the current effects on natural environment and human life is mainly due to global warming to some extent. According to the IPCC report&#44; glacier retreat&#44; ice shelf disruption like the Larsen ice shelf&#44; rise in the sea level&#44; and extreme weather events are attributed to the global warning.26300_139 	A2FDXVWVI05XA4 	It is indeed very challenging to attribute the changes in the overall pattern&#44; rapidity and intensity to global warming alone. Other effects include water scarcity&#44; increase in precipitation in some regions&#44; changes in snowpacks and increase in warmer climate&#44; which will have a debilitating effect on human health.26300_140 	A2FDXVWVI05XA4 	Extreme weather due to increased mortality; displacements and economic loss will be compounded through growing population. Although&#44; temperate climate has some benefits out of it such as decreased mortality due to cold weather.26300_141 	A2FDXVWVI05XA4 	Report drafted by the second executive group of IPCC Third Assessment Report&#44; presents A comprehensive explanation of the potential effects and a summary can be found in the draft submitted by the second executive group of IPCC Third Assessment Report. According to the new IPCC Assessment Report (IPCC Fourth Assessment Report)&#44; there are evidences that north pacific ocean has experienced increased tropical cyclone since 1970. The states that it is difficult to assess a long-term effects of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation&#44; as there is relatively little data available before the advent of satellites for these studies. Neither does it establishes the  effects of  tropical cyclones on the trends in the annual calculations.26300_143 	A2FDXVWVI05XA4 	It is anticipated that global warming will increase in its geographical strength and capacity.26300_144 	A2FDXVWVI05XA4 	Climate change can increase susceptibility of tropical diseases like malaria&#44; in region such as entire Europe&#44; North America&#44; as well as Northern Asia.26300_149 	A2FDXVWVI05XA4 	The increase beyond the expected temperatures in the stabilization scenarios (Color band) pattern is reflected by the presence of black line in the shaded region (primary doubt)&#44; while the red line and blue line signifies possibility under the guidance of IPCC AR4.26300_151 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Stern Review    A global report is published dealing with the possible economic effects; This indicates that the most difficult period in the world can be less&#44; gross domestic product can increase by about one percent&#44; and in the worst case per capita income can fall by 20 percent. Economists have criticised this report&#44; its method and discussion&#44; nainly the assumtiions of discounting and alternatives of its levels.  Whereas some others have supported the calculations of the economic risk&#44; even if they are not in agreement with the figures.26300_152 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Introductory chapters demonstrate that the cost and benifits of reducing global warming are by and large comparable with each other.26300_153 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)&#44; the economic areas of activity likely to face hardsip are banks&#44; agriculture&#44; transport and others.  Developing countries dependent on agriculture will prominently be affected by global warming.26300_156 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Some have suggested that the production of fossil fuels should be enforced in accordance to a quota&#44; because it is directly related to emission of carbon dioxide.26300_157 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Business action on climate change is also underway&#44; like improving the energy efficiency and using alternative fuels.  The concept of the status report is to encourage emissions trading&#44; by which companies control the emissions joining hands with the Governments.26300_158 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Kyoto Protocol is the fundamental international agreement to control global worming&#44; a rider to the UNDCCC&#44; which came up in 1997.  In this protocol&#44; there are more than 160 countries and at the international level 55% divisions dealing with universal green house gases emissions.  Only United States of America and Kajaksthan have not signed this protocol&#44; though America is the largest emitter of green house gases.  This protocos will come to an end in 2012&#44; and International treaty starting in May 2007&#44; will replace it.26300_159 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	According to George W Bush in relation to the Kyoto Protocol&#44; India and China have caused 80% of the global warming and it has caused immense damage to the american economy.He says that it is unfair and false to saythis because he has encouraged alternate energy souces in his technological advancement.Many states have started their operations in accordance with the yoto Protocol. An example of this is the Regional Greenhouse Gas initiative. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program is a programme of which more than 20 U.S. agencies are a part.26300_161 	A3PWE6Y56BRAT9 	The work group III of IPCC to prepare a report on expenditure and profit of different of different views on global warming&#44;the IPCC fourth assessment report has concluded that no single technology or sector is responsible to overcome the global warming. They find that&#44;in the different fields of technology&#44;viz.energy supply&#44;transportation&#44;industry and agriculture&#44;some main customs should be included.According to an estimate&#44;the stabilization of carbon dioxide equivalent between 445 to 710 ppm can increase or decrease the gross domestic product by 0.6 to 3%.26300_162 	A3PWE6Y56BRAT9 	according to the work group III&#44; if the increasing temperature is to be controlled by 2 degree Celsius&#44; one group will have to reduce its emission&#44; and by 2020&#44;the emission should be less than the level of 1990(less than by 40 to 90% than 1990 levels in the the highest emission regions) regions&#44; and even less by 2050 (less than 40 to 90% than 1990 levels)&#44;even if the developing nations do more reduction.26300_163 	A3PWE6Y56BRAT9 	The social and political discussion.26300_166 	A1ZW3EUAHC0BSH 	Greenhouse gas emissions per person&#44; including land use (land-use change) involves changes26300_169 	A1ZW3EUAHC0BSH 	Greenhouse gas emissions per country in which land use change26300_170 	A3PWE6Y56BRAT9 	Due to the popularity of the scientific research&#44;a political and economical discussion has started. The poor countries&#44;specially Africa&#44;has a greater threat&#44;though its emissions are far less than the America.26300_171 	A3PWE6Y56BRAT9 	Along with this the exclusion of developing nations from Kyoto protocol has been disapproved by USA and Australia&#44;it has been projected as an issue against America.26300_172 	A3PWE6Y56BRAT9 	In comparison of western world&#44; Europe has a stronger opinion about the affects of man on climate.26300_174 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Another topic of debate is how can emerging economies like China and India can be expected to reduce emission levels.According to recent reports&#44;the gross national carbon dioxide emission levels of China may be higher than those of the United States&#44; but China states that the per capita emissions are five times lesser than those of the United States&#44; and hence it should not be forced to take any actions.India too is free from Kyoto Protocal since it is a source of great industrial production.However&#44; the U.S. contends that if they must bear the cost of reducing emissions&#44; then China should do the same.26300_176 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	There are several questions raised in relation to global warming.One among them is the acidification of the oceans.26300_177 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Due to oceanic acidification&#44; the levels of caorbon dioxide in the atmosphere increase.26300_179 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	There are possibilities of the acidic content to rise. In 2100&#44; it is likely to be 0.14 to 0.5 because the oceanic waters will absorb the carbon dioxide.26300_180 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Marine life can be sustained in waters which are of lesser pH value&#44; hence there is a possibility of their extinction.The rising levels of carbon dioxide will affect human life and food webs&#44; which depend upon the seas for their life.26300_181 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Irradiance&#44; or the absorption of light by the earth may have reduced global warming in the 20th century. In 1960 to 1990&#44; the earth had received lesser light in comparison. Man-produced aerosols increased the levels&#44; and if they are not present&#44; volcanic actions and emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to be harmful.26300_182 	A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI 	Ozone depletion- in which the ozone levels in the Stratosphere decrease. This has increased global warming. There is a relation between the two factors though it is not said to be a powerful one.26300_190 	AKQGPDRQZ06OC 	India is working on the report of climate panel based on the climate changes.26300_191 	AKQGPDRQZ06OC 	nature gives information about the climate changes.26300_192 	A1ZYNAB4UPQ1UF 	Briton&#39;s Meterological Department Haidli center&#39;s web site.26300_193 	A1ZYNAB4UPQ1UF 	NOAA&#39;s FAQs on global warming26300_195 	A3IHCT015XNNJK 	Warning on Global Climate Change26300_196 	A2V3FO3J6XUPQK 	Effects of global warming on animals(United Nation&#39;s report)26300_198 	A2V3FO3J6XUPQK 	Global Environmental Change:NASA&#39;s eyes on the Earth -- Environmental overviews&#44; main points&#44; multimedia and current news.26300_200 	A2V3FO3J6XUPQK 	By National Geographic - Ideological Presentation26300_201 	A2SV5WZJJJTTEU 	Educational Global Climate Modeling Project - an independent research and the students do this for scientist interface on their desktop computer can simulate global warming26300_202 	A3IHCT015XNNJK 	Sea &amp; Climate data received from &quot;DISCOVER 1979&quot;&#44; NASA owned satellite26300_203 	A2V3FO3J6XUPQK 	The Pew center is known for keeping an eye over the environmental changes all over the world.26300_205 	A1ZW3EUAHC0BSH 	Best efforts for global warming Trejetcoris by Harvey Lam (Princeton University) The wolfram Demonstrations Project26300_207 	A2CM1RPNTAVTH 	science and technology source on internet- A comprehensive list of Internet resources26300_208 	A1ZW3EUAHC0BSH 	Union of Concerned Scientists Global Warming related page26300_210 	A1ZW3EUAHC0BSH 	United Nations system&#39;s work on climate change for a gateway28539_101 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Serious bad assaults by local pollution helped improve awareness.  PCB: In 1974&#44; EPA inposed a ban on use of fish from Hudson river&#44; as a result of filth and garbage being thrown in it.  IN 1947&#44; dioxin pollution of Love Canal started&#44; and continued for a long time&#44; became a national news in 1978&#44; and as its consequence the Super Fund Law of 1980 was made.  In 1990&#44; legal machinery brought to light production of Chromium -6 in California&#44; whose victims were champions and they became famous.  By reason of pollution of industrial land&#44; one word originated - Brownfield.  This word has now become an integral part of city planning.After the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson&#44; DDT was banned in most of the developed world.28539_102 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Due to the development of nuclear science&#44; radioactive contamination happened.  This can remain harmful for hundreds of thousands of years.  Lake Karachey was named by Worldwatch Institute as &quot;the most polluted place on earth&quot;&#44; this place was used as a dumping place for waste and refuge by Soviet Union between 1950 and 1960.  Second place is U.S.S.R.&#39;s Chelyabinsk&#44; &quot;The Most Contaminated Spot on the Planet&quot;.28539_103 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	During the cold war&#44; research into the nuclear weapons was being done&#44; specially in the early stages of their development&#44; sometimes near the settlement regions also.  The effect of this on population and its development is very bad&#44; radioactivity is a serious danger to human health&#44; the difficulties in banning it are related to nuclear power.  Though lot of caution is exercised in this field&#44; still the magnitude of the damage caused by the incidents of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl caused a disbelief in people&#44; considering future difficulties.  Most forms of nuclear research were banned.  Even before imposing restrictions&#44; the limit of background radiation was increased very much.28539_104 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	International calamities like the ship disaster of oil tanker ship&#44; Amoco Cadiz in 1978 on the shores of Brittany&#44; and Bhopal disaster in 1984 have shown the universality of such happenings&#44; and there is a need to try and address them in a decisive manner.  The boundariless nature of space and oceans has definitely increased the pollution on earth at the planetary level&#44; the issue of global worming is also related to this.  Very recently&#44; one word&#44; Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP) has come into vogue&#44; which describes a special group among chemicals. like PBDE and PFC.  For want of enough practical data the effect of this group of chemicals is not understood well.  But still its existence has come to light in ecological regions like the Arctic region which are away from the industrial processes&#44; which reveal in comparatively short time existence of such spread out biological groups of chemicals after widespread use.28539_106 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Philosophical recognition/accreditation28539_107 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	During renaissance&#44; from the period of Central European history till today&#44; different writers from Andalusia of Ancient Greece&#44; Ancient China&#44; like Aristotle&#44; Al-Farabi&#44; Al-Ghazali&#44; Averrois&#44; Buddha&#44; Confucius&#44; Dante&#44; Hagel&#44; Avicenna&#44; Lao-Tse&#44; Maimonedes&#44; Montesquiew&#44; Nussbaum&#44; Pluto&#44; Socrates&#44; and Sun Tzu have written about the pollution of the body&#44; the mind and the soul.28539_109 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	The ancient form of the pollution caused by the living beings was a natural result of their existence.  Effect of population size and its activities has fallen below the frame of the natural selection.  In this are included reduction of population at the regional level&#44; or towards the end extinction of the species.  In the processes which were not clear&#44; a new balance is established between their resultant modifications and adaptations.  For life of any form&#44;mfor its existence&#44; pollution has crossed the last boundary.28539_111 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Trademark dilution is a trademark law concept giving the owner of a famous trademark standing to forbid others from using that mark in a way that would lessen its uniqueness. In most cases&#44; trademark dilution involves an unauthorized use of another&#39;s trademark on products that do not compete with&#44; and have little connection with&#44; those of the trademark owner. For example&#44; a famous trademark used by one company to refer to hair care products might be diluted if another company began using a similar mark to refer to breakfast cereals or spark plugs28539_112 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	It is useful to consider that environmental policy comprises two major terms: environment and policy. Environment primarily refers to the ecological dimension (ecosystems)&#44; but can also take account of social dimension (quality of life) and an economic dimension (resource management). [2] Policy can be defined as a &quot;course of action or principle adopted or proposed by a government&#44; party&#44; business or individual&quot; [3]. Thus&#44; environmental policy focuses on problems arising from human impact on the environment&#44; which retroacts onto human society by having a (negative) impact on human values such as good health or the &#39;clean and green&#39; environment.    Environmental issues generally addressed by environmental policy include (but are not limited to) air and water pollution&#44; waste management&#44; ecosystem management&#44; biodiversity protection&#44; and the protection of natural resources&#44; wildlife and endangered species. Relatively recently&#44; environmental policy has also attended to the communication of environmental issues28539_113 	A1GEUMI28IQ2PS 	Often&#44; several instruments are combined in an instrument mix formulated to address a certain environmental problem. Since environmental issues often have many different aspects&#44; several policy instruments may be needed to adequately address each one. Furthermore&#44; instrument mixes may allow firms greater flexibility in finding ways to comply with government policy while reducing the uncertainty in the cost of doing so. However&#44; instrument mixes must be carefully formulated so that the individual measures within them do not undermine each other or create a rigid and cost-ineffective compliance framework. Also&#44; overlapping instruments lead to unnecessary administrative costs&#44; making implementation of environmental policies more costly than necessary.In order to help governments realize their environmental policy goals&#44; the OECD Environment Directorate studies and collects data on the efficiency of the environmental instruments governments use to achieve their goals as well as their consequences for other policies.28539_116 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	An established pollutant affects the entire population or the traditionally vulnerable groups.28539_117 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	Different specified effects are there on different species.28539_118 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	These effects can be quite ordinary&#44; or can lead to secondary or tertiary effects on biodiversity.28539_119 	AL9K2BNO4E0F4 	An effect may be insignificant now&#44; but will show up significantly in future.28539_121 	A1DA91W9F7L8XT 	Pollutants are firsthand appearance of loss.28539_122 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	If strength of pollutant is lowered then it will have impact on employment and economic prosperity.28539_123 	A1L60D3USUDQRB 	Growth of Algae and eutrophication on the bank of lakes and ocean is considered as pollution&#44; when this happens due to nutrients coming from point source or nonpoint source of industry&#44; agriculture or residential area (for detail see Note on eutrophication)28539_124 	A5L716F3F5R7V 	Heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury have an important role in the geochemical cycle and these are found in the natural form. These metals also can be mined&#44; and they can be released in the atmosphere on a large scale on the basis of purification process&#44; where they were not present earlier. The effect caused by releasing these metals in the environment can be a cause of pollution.This type of historical effect on the environment can be the cause of natural geochemical reactions.28539_126 	A5L716F3F5R7V 	Carbon dioxide &#44; which is important for photosynthesis many times becomes the cause of pollution&#44; because the increased parameter of this gas in the environment affects the habitat  of earth.destruction of Environment establishes a relation between  polluted zones&#44; which are generally divided into different classifications of air and water pollution. Recently study shows the increased level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere&#44; by which the acidity of sea water is slightly increased. This is an complicated condition and it will be affecting the aquatic food chain.28539_131 	A3P2WQO8VESWF2 	Environmental Assessment Agency-- Canada28539_132 	A3P2WQO8VESWF2 	Environmental Protection Agency--United states of America28539_133 	AVWWDENWU115I 	Environment Protection Organization28539_134 	A3P2WQO8VESWF2 	Extoxnet News letter- News on Environmental pollution-Last edition 199828539_136 	AKF3931IMVZ82 	Institute for Energy and Environmental Research28539_139 	A112IE8PQYXT3Q 	From National Health Institute of United States of america - National Toxicology Program.
