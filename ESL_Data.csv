There are many iconic temples&#44; mosques&#44; and churches situated in the city. Hyderabad&#39;s Muslim community is the largest in Andhra Pradesh. (see also: Hyderabadi Muslims).[26] Muslims have substantial presence across the city and are predominant in and around Old City. Churches are located across the city and the popular ones are in Abids and Secunderabad areas.Hyderabad is connected to the rest of the country by National HighwaysNH-7&#44; NH-9 and NH-202. Hyderabad is also well connected to the remaining parts of the state. Like other cities&#44; Hyderabad suffers from traffic congestion. Completion of the Inner Ring Road and construction of the Outer Ring Road encircling Hyderabad city is also underway and is touted to make travel in the city easier. Many flyovers and underpasses are also being constructed to ease traffic congestion in the city.The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation[43] runs a fleet of 19&#44;000 buses&#44; the largest in the world.[41] Hyderabad has the third largest bus station facility in Asia&#44; with 72 platforms for 89 buses to load passengers at a time. Officially named as the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station&#44; it is locally known as the Imlibun Bus Station&#44; Jubilee Bus Station at Secunderabad runs buses to various parts of the state and to some parts of South India.  The yellow colored Auto Rickshaw usually referred to as an auto&#44; is the most widely used transport service and has flag down minimum fare of Rs 12 for first 1.5 km and then Rs 7 per km. Radio Taxis and cabs by private players have provided an easy travel in the city.,209184960_178 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,his temple was constructed by King Harihara Bukka Rayalu of the Sangama Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century. It was built according to Vaishnavaite traditions.  One story of the site&#39;s origin is as follows: The sage Agastya wanted to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site. However&#44; the statue that was made could not be installed as the toenail of the deity got broken. The sage was upset over this and performed a penance for Lord Shiva. When Lord Shiva appeared&#44; he said the place suits Shiva better as it resembles Kailash. Agastya then requested Lord Shiva to give the devotees a Parvathi Goddess as Lord Uma Maheswara in a single stone&#44; which Lord Shiva obliged.  A second story is as follows: Chitteppa&#44; a devotee of Lord Shiva&#44; was worshiping Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva appeared to him as a tiger. Chitteppa understood that it was Lord Shiva in tiger form&#44; and shouted Neganti Shivanu ne khanti (meaning: I saw Shiva I saw)&#44; and danced with joy. There is a cave called Chitteppa nearby.    The story according to the priests is that when the sage Agastya compleated his uttara desha yatra and started dakshina desha yatra he found the beautiful and pleasent place called yaganti( Nekanti-i have seen)and thought to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site . while roaming around caves one of the caves was found to have a very old statue of Lord Vishnu . After all the yagna&#44; homa and poojas he found that the statue really contains a small defect as broken nail on the foot thumb finger. To seek an explanation he prayed to Shiva and Shiva explained that at this place which contains natural springs and nature only I can be worshipped. Then the sage Agastya asked a boom to Shiva to reside in this place for eternity with Mother Parvathi. So this place is called as Umamahesware (ume: parvathi&#44; maheswara: shiva) temple. The shrine contains the statue of Shiva and Parvathi on a single stone.,198045708_65 ,A370556EFVZ9W4 ,We cannot undestand classical music unless and until we hear it and try to understand the quality and beauty of its components. The same is the case of a sex position when a man is on top. This is that time when one needs to make the classic position more elegant and find out why it is a classic position. Another thing that needs to be understood is that when the man is on top&#44; it does not have to mean that the woman is going to experience idle and powerful sexual gerations. Nor these positions can be called the boring positions of the past just the way some people think about the positions that involve men on top. By making some small changes these positions can be made elegant. In all this positions effort needs to be made by the man. Before any inital position it is better to talk to your partner. If there is any kind of communication gap&#44; then no position would be comfortable for both the partners. This means that every woman wants that her mate has such size and shape that can push her to the limits of sexual excitement and for this there is a need for a great position that has been discussed and decided according to her needs and which pushes her to the limit of sexual climax. If they are successful in doing this just once&#44; they can repeat whenever they want to reach the limits of sexual excitement. One thing that needs to be told is that most men choose men on top position so that they can reach an orgasm. This is why the men on top position is a powerful position. But is in this position is the man is fast and powerful from the begining then it may lead to loss of feeling and stamina at the end. This position is very good for those who are relatively new to sex&#44; but when excitement is taken into consideration this position is good for everyone. This is why it is necessary that the women tell their partner to stay in control and try to experiment and determine which position is good for satisfcation of both their needs.,19761149_208 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The process of attaching a magnetic stripe to a plastic card was invented by IBM under a contract with the US government for a security system. Forrest Parry&#44; an IBM Engineer&#44; had the idea of securing a piece of magnetic tape&#44; the predominant storage medium at the time&#44; to a plastic card base. He became frustrated because every adhesive he tried produced unacceptable results. The tape strip either warped or its characteristics were affected by the adhesive&#44; rendering the tape strip unusable. After a frustrating day in the laboratory&#44; trying to get the right adhesive&#44; he came home with several pieces of magnetic tape and several plastic cards. As he walked in the door at home&#44; his wife was ironing and watching TV. She immediately saw the frustration on his face and asked what was wrong. He explained the source of his frustration: inability to get the tape to &quot;stick&quot; to the plastic in a way that would work. She said&#44; &quot;Here&#44; let me try the iron.&quot; She did and the problem was solved. The heat of the iron was just high enough to bond the tape to the card.There were a number of steps required to convert the magnetic striped media into an industry acceptable device. These steps included: 1) Creating the international standards for stripe record content&#44; including which information&#44; in what format&#44; and using which defining codes. 2) Field testing the proposed device and standards for market acceptance. 3) Developing the manufacturing steps needed to mass produce the large number of cards required. 4) Adding stripe issue and acceptance capabilities to available equipment. These steps were initially managed by Jerome Svigals of the Advanced Systems Division of IBM&#44; Los Gatos&#44; California from 1966 to 1975.,180372463_100 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,In a 2003 study of Wikipedia as a community&#44; economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in wiki software create a catalyst for collaborative development&#44; and that a &quot;creative construction&quot; approach encourages participation.[130] In his 2008 book&#44; The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It&#44; Jonathan Zittrain of the Oxford Internet Institute and Harvard Law Schools Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society cites Wikipedia&#39;s success as a case study in how open collaboration has fostered innovation on the web.[131] A 2008 study found that Wikipedia users were less agreeable and open&#44; though more conscientious&#44; than non-Wikipedia users.[132][133] A 2009 study suggested there was &quot;evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content.&quot;[134]  At OOPSLA 2009&#44; Wikimedia CTO and Senior Software Architect Brion Vibber gave a presentation entitled &quot;Community Performance Optimization: Making Your People Run as Smoothly as Your Site&quot;[135] in which he discussed the challenges of handling the contributions from a large community and compared the process to that of software development.        Wikipedians and British Museum curators collaboration on the article Hoxne Hoard in June 2010.  The Wikipedia Signpost is the community newspaper on the English Wikipedia&#44;[136] and was founded by Michael Snow&#44; an administrator and the former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees.[137] It covers news and events from the site&#44; as well as major events from sister projects&#44; such as Wikimedia Commons,16621149_14 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,In the 1960s&#44; Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#44; AT&amp;T Bell Labs&#44; and General Electric developed an experimental operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.[2] Multics was highly innovative&#44; but had many problems.  Bell Labs&#44; frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims&#44; slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics&#44; Ken Thompson&#44; Dennis Ritchie&#44; M. D. McIlroy&#44; and J. F. Ossanna&#44;[3] decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. At the time&#44; Ritchie says &quot;What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming&#44; but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing&#44; as supplied by remote-access&#44; time-shared machines&#44; is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch&#44; but to encourage close communication.&quot;[3]  While Ken Thompson still had access to the Multics environment&#44; he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it. He also programmed a game called Space Travel&#44; but the game needed a more efficient and less expensive machine to run on&#44; and eventually a little-used PDP-7 at Bell Labs fit the bill.[4] On this PDP7&#44; a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie&#44; including Rudd Canaday&#44; developed a hierarchical file system&#44; the notions of computer processes and device files&#44; a command-line interpreter&#44; and some small utility programs,15741149_209 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Magstripes following these specifications can typically be read by most point-of-sale hardware&#44; which are simply general-purpose computers that can be programmed to perform specific tasks. Examples of cards adhering to these standards include ATM cards&#44; bank cards (credit and debit cards including VISA and MasterCard)&#44; gift cards&#44; loyalty cards&#44; driver&#39;s licenses&#44; telephone cards&#44; membership cards&#44; electronic benefit transfer cards (e.g. food stamps)&#44; and nearly any application in which value or secure information is not stored on the card itself. Many video game and amusement centers now use debit card systems based on magnetic stripe cards.  Magnetic stripe cloning can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature known as a MagnePrint or BluPrint can be used in conjunction with common two factor authentication schemes utilized in ATM&#44; debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.[2][3]  Counterexamples of cards which intentionally ignore ISO standards include hotel key cards&#44; most subway and bus cards&#44; and some national prepaid calling cards (such as for the country of Cyprus) in which the balance is stored and maintained directly on the stripe and not retrieved from a remote database.,141263528_47 ,AMKGJUEEY6ZCH ,machine&#44; magazine&#44; magistrate&#44; midterm&#44; mail&#44; main&#44; member&#44; major&#44; makeup&#44; manager&#44; mandate&#44; mini fold paper&#44; manners&#44; mature&#44; medical college&#44; mechanic&#44; medium&#44; m.l.a&#44; tomato&#44; mental&#44; merit&#44; manage&#44;metal&#44; metric&#44; mile&#44; military&#44; mill&#44; mineral&#44; minister&#44; minor&#44; minority&#44; mint&#44; minus&#44; missionary&#44; mini toss&#44; missile&#44; mixture&#44; mobile&#44; model&#44; money order&#44; monthly&#44; municipality&#44; mummy&#44; meter&#44; same plate&#44; narrow gaze&#44; n.c.c.navy&#44; negative&#44; net cash&#44; network&#44; newsreel&#44; night fit&#44; no vacancy&#44; nomination&#44; non teaching staff&#44; normal&#44; notary&#44; note&#44; notice&#44; naval&#44; nuisance&#44; number&#44; nurse&#44; offer&#44; officer&#44; office&#44; oil paints&#44; Olympics&#44; on duty&#44; open air theater&#44; operator&#44; operation&#44; opposition&#44; option&#44; order&#44; ordinary&#44; organization&#44; out door shooting&#44; original&#44; opt patient (o.p)&#44; over bridge&#44; over draft&#44; over hall&#44; over time&#44; owner&#44; over head tank&#44; packet&#44; page&#44; painter&#44; paper&#44; parcel&#44; partner&#44; parents&#44; prestige&#44; parliament&#44; petrol&#44; party&#44; part time&#44; pass&#44; passbook&#44; passenger&#44; passport&#44;,13951149_164 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,prior releases of Windows supported per-file encryption using Encrypting File System&#44; the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista include BitLocker Drive Encryption which can protect entire volumes&#44; notably the operating system volume. However&#44; BitLocker requires approximately a 1.5-gigabyte partition to be permanently unencrypted and to contain system files in order for Windows to boot. In normal circumstances&#44; the only time this partition is accessed is when the computer is booting&#44; or when there is a Windows update that changes files in this area which is a legitimate reason to access this section of the drive. The area can be a potential security issue&#44; because a hexadecimal editor (such as dskprobe.exe)&#44; or malicious software running with administrator and/or kernel level privileges would be able to write to this &quot;Ghost Partition&quot; and allow a piece of malicious software to compromise the system&#44; or disable the encryption. BitLocker can work in conjunction with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cryptoprocessor (version 1.2) embedded in a computer&#39;s motherboard&#44; or with a USB key.[38] However&#44; as with other full disk encryption technologies&#44; BitLocker is vulnerable to a cold boot attack&#44; especially where TPM is used as a key protector without a boot PIN being required too,13578066_129 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,In 2008 Presidential election&#44; political candidates are using the You Tube for the campaign.  The voters can watch the thought patterns of the candidates.  The presidential candidates were for example Ron Paul&#44; Hillery Clinton&#44; and Joe Biden.  Videos can be made for the ruling party or the opposition party.  Presidential candidates from the third group also used the publicity of You Tube.  Libertarian Steve Kubby&#39;s campaign debuted a short animated film&#44; featuring the faces and voices of campaign contributors who financed its production&#44; on YouTube on September 29th&#44; 2007.  U.S. media have often commented that YouTube played a significant role in the defeat of the Republican Senator George Allen in 2006&#44; because the videoclip of alleged racial comments was shown to the YouTube viewers during the campaign.  A political commentator like James Kotecki is also in the YouTube&#39;s political arena.  Many commentators make videos for the Presidential candidates on the YouTube or use the YouTube for airing their views.  Currently&#44; political leaders of France and Italy&#44; like Antonio Di Pietro also are making the site a part of their campaigns.  For gettin a lead in the Federal elections of 2007&#44; the ex-Prime Minister of Australia John Howard&#44; used the YouTube also.,132545708_95 ,A1DKOLR0AU5RPS ,Machinery position is the historic position&#44; according  to senses 91 percent of men and women enjoys this  historic position.In this position there would be  the maximum satisfaction between men and women.The   machinery position is mean to be the longest duration  of sex for both men and women. In this position women  spreads her legs or keeps her legs closer so that men  can lay over her to insert his penis to her vagina and  increase his speed.In this position men uses his hands   for balance himself.In this position men get the full  freedom for his speed while intercourse. If women has to  bend over during sex more than she can then the men reduces  his weight from his partner.In this position women can   put all the weight of her center of the body to her legs  for the balance(when she has the temptation or the   if she needs to enjoy the maximum pleasure of sex)or she  can hold her partners hip with her legs to decrease the speed. Women should has to avoid these position while  pregnancy and the during back pain.If women has the   back pain then she can make the balls of bathing towels  and keep it in the back side and pillows below the thighs  were she lays to have sex.This is the famous position in India.

This is basically a position for oral sex.  In this the man lies down stright on his back and the woman with the support of her knees brings her cunt area onto the top of the face of the man.  This is liked very much because the control is with the woman and she can change her focus by moving back and forth.  For more pressure&#44; she can move a bit down and get the pleasure of increase in excitement.  Rodeo: This is the reverse of the horse riding position.In this the man can see the backside portion of the woman&#44; and there is some difficulty in reaching her breasts&#44; etc.  Those having difficulty to slide in the horse riding position&#44; for them this is the right positio for g-spot friction.  Even so&#44; in this positon&#44; the spot can be rubbed in many ways and the man gets a fair portion of the act of penetration.  In this the man lies down on his back and the woman keeping her seat towards his face&#44; comes on to the top of his prick on her knees&#44; and gets the entry done.  She gives support to her body by propping her hands in the mans&#39;s palms.  Because of this&#44; in this position&#44; intense and easy intercourse is achieved.,12991149_222 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,While these new features and security improvements have garnered positive reviews&#44; Vista has also been the target of much criticism and negative press. Criticism of Windows Vista has targeted its high system requirements&#44; its more restrictive licensing terms&#44; the inclusion of a number of new digital rights management technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media&#44; lack of compatibility with some pre-Vista hardware and software&#44; and the number of authorization prompts for User Account Control. As a result of these and other issues&#44; Windows Vista had seen initial adoption and satisfaction rates lower than Windows XP.[9] However&#44; with an estimated 330 million Internet users as of January 2009&#44; it had been announced that Vista usage had surpassed Microsofts pre-launch two-year-out expectations of achieving 200 million users.[10][11] At the release of Windows 7 (October 2009)&#44; Windows Vista (with approximately 400 million Internet users) was the second most widely used operating system on the Internet with an approximately 18.6% market share&#44; the most widely used being Windows XP with an approximately 63.3% market share.[12] As of May 2010&#44; Windows Vista&#39;s market share estimates range from 15.26% to 26.04%,129463528_50 ,A2ZKW63AU1NQ21 ,car&#44; corner&#44; rack&#44; radio&#44; riding&#44; rail&#44; rice&#44; raingauge&#44;royal&#44; range&#44; rank&#44; race&#44; rate&#44;ration&#44; R.C.C&#44; reaction&#44;reader&#44; reactor&#44; recreation club&#44; reading room&#44; readymade&#44;reel&#44; real estate&#44; reason&#44; rebate&#44; recall&#44; receipt&#44; reception&#44;recognition&#44; record&#44; recounting&#44; recovery&#44; recruitment&#44; R.D&#44; reference&#44; referendum&#44; refund&#44; registered post&#44; resignation&#44;register&#44; regular&#44; relation&#44; release&#44; reminder&#44; remission&#44; remote control&#44; renewal&#44; recharge coupon.repair&#44; reveil&#44;revert&#44; representation&#44; republic&#44; request&#44; satma&#44; reveal&#44;reaserch&#44; reservation&#44; residence&#44; resign&#44; receivekut&#44; rest&#44;recessable&#44; result&#44; retail dealer&#44; retirement&#44; revenue&#44;reversion&#44; riharud&#44; ribbon&#44; right&#44; risk&#44; robot&#44; roll number&#44;rough&#44; rotation&#44; route&#44; royal&#44; royalty&#44; rubber hunter&#44;rules&#44; running&#44; room&#44; rench&#44; road&#44; razor&#44; ring road&#44; regulator&#44; reservoir&#44; safety locker&#44; salary&#44; sales&#44; saline&#44;sanction&#44;,124572463_95 ,A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 ,The English edition of Wikipedia plans to trial a related approach.[47][48] In June 2010&#44; it was announced that the English Wikipedia would remove strict editing restrictions from &quot;controversial&quot; or vandalism-prone articles (such as George W. Bush&#44; David Cameron or homework). In place of an editing prohibition for new or unregistered users&#44; there would be a &quot;new system&#44; called &#39;pending changes&#39;&quot; which&#44; Jimmy Wales told the British Broadcasting Corporation&#44; would enable the English Wikipedia &quot;to open up articles for general editing that have been protected or semi-protected for years.&quot; The &quot;pending changes&quot; system was introduced on June 15&#44; shortly after 11pm GMT. Edits to specified articles are now &quot;subject to review from an established Wikipedia editor before publication.&quot; Wales opted against the German Wikipedia model of requiring editor review before edits to any article&#44; describing it as &quot;neither necessary nor desirable.&quot; He added that the administrators of the German Wikipedia were &quot;going to be closely watching the English system&#44; and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll at least consider switching if the results are good.,12421149_264 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,In 2005&#44; Sun Microsystems released the bulk of its Solaris system code (based on UNIX System V Release 4) into an open source project called OpenSolaris. New Sun OS technologies&#44; notably the ZFS file system&#44; were first released as open source code via the OpenSolaris project. Soon afterwards&#44; OpenSolaris spawned several non-Sun distributions. In 2010&#44; after Oracle acquired Sun&#44; OpenSolaris was officially discontinued&#44; but the development of derivatives continued.the core tool kit of the Unix command set&#44; including cp&#44; ls&#44; grep&#44; find and many others. Subcategories include:  System utilities  administrative tools such as mkfs&#44; fsck&#44; and many others.  User utilities  environment management tools such as passwd&#44; kill&#44; and others.Shortly after UNIX System V Release 4 was produced&#44; AT&amp;T sold all its rights to UNIX to Novell. (Dennis Ritchie likened this to the Biblical story of Esau selling his birthright for the proverbial &quot;mess of pottage&quot;.[9]) Novell developed its own version&#44; UnixWare&#44; merging its NetWare with UNIX System V Release 4. Novell tried to use this to battle against Windows NT&#44; but their core markets suffered considerably.,12391149_335 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Unix (officially trademarked as UNIX&#44; sometimes also written as Unix with small caps) is a computer operating system originally developed in 1969 by a group of AT&amp;T employees at Bell Labs&#44; including Ken Thompson&#44; Dennis Ritchie&#44; Brian Kernighan&#44; Douglas McIlroy&#44; and Joe Ossanna. Today&#39;s Unix systems are split into various branches&#44; developed over time by AT&amp;Toriginally on the PDP-11 architecture (the 2.xBSD releases&#44; ending with 2.11BSD) and later for the VAX-11 (the 4.x BSD releases). Many contributions to Unix first appeared on BSD releases&#44; notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel. The BSD effort produced several significant releases that contained network code: 4.1cBSD&#44; 4.2BSD&#44; 4.3BSD&#44; 4.3BSD-Tahoe (&quot;Tahoe&quot; being the nickname of the Computer Consoles Inc. Power 6/32 architecture that was the first non-DEC release of the BSD kernel)&#44; Net/1&#44; 4.3BSD-Reno (to match the &quot;Tahoe&quot; naming&#44; and that the release was something of a gamble)&#44; Net/2&#44; 4.4BSD&#44; and 4.4BSD-lite.,123172463_80 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,60% of registered users never make another edit after their first 24 hours. Possible explanations are that such users only register for a single purpose&#44; or are scared away by their experiences.[143] Goldman writes that editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals&#44; such as signing talk pages&#44; implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders&#44; increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders will target their contributions as a threat. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs; the contributor is expected to build a user page&#44; learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes&#44; submit to an arcane dispute resolution process&#44; and learn a &quot;baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references.&quot; Non-logged-in users are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia&#44;[144] as &quot;participants are accredited by members of the wiki community&#44; who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product&#44; on the basis of their ongoing participation&#44;&quot;[145] but the contribution histories of IP addresses cannot necessarily with any certainty be credited to&#44; or blamed upon&#44; a particular user.,120281232_15 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Vedavyasa taught the Puranas to one of his disciples named Romaharshana or Lomaharshana. He was thus named because the hair (roma) on his body was thrilled (harshana) when he heard the Puranas from his teacher. It was Romaharshana who related the stories of the Puranas to everyone else. The Bhagavata Purana says the Romaharshana had a son named Suta and it was this son who related the story of that particular Purana to the other sages . On the other hand&#44; Romaharshana himself belonged to the suta class&#44; so that he too could be addressed as Suta. From reading the Garuda Purana&#44; one does get the impression that it is Romaharshana himself who is relating the story&#44; and not his son.  To come back to the point&#44; Romaharshana came to a forest known as Naimisharanya. He sat there and contemplated the mysteries of the Lord Vishnu.  Several other rishis (sages) led by Shounaka also came to the forest. They told Romaharshana&#44; &quot;Sage&#44; you know everything. Who is the god of all gods? Who is to be worshipped? What does one meditate on? Who destroys evil? How did the world come to be created? What is dharma (righteousness)? Tell us all these things and more&quot;.,119945708_39 ,A1O9BHBJKVI5PS ,As the name suggests the woman behaves as if she is riding a horse. Just as the rider jumps up and down because of the jerks of the horse during riding&#44; similarly the woman creates this state during coitus. This position is one of the most liked positions for some women. This is also liked by women who feel it is their right to start and men like to see them do this. In this the man lies down on his back. During this he can raise his shoulders/head region with the help of a pillow. Now the woman should sit facing him. During this the man&#39;s body will be between the woman&#39;s legs and the woman&#39;s vagina will be above or in front of the man&#39;s penis. After this the horse-rider position divides into two methods. In the first method the woman brings her face very close to the man&#39;s face. This gives an opportunity to kiss. During this she places her hands next to the man&#39;s shoulders and uses them for support and her legs are parallel to the bed. In the second method the woman places her hands behind her and bends backwards. In this method the man can fully see his penis entering the vagina which is helpful in greatly exciting him.

The focus of the first chapter&#44; &quot;Gandhi&#44; native Africans and Indians in colonial condition&quot; is on &quot;White Rule&quot;&#44; on the relationship of Indian and African communities and on those policies because of which they were divided (and they argue that the conflict between these communities was big).  They say about these relationships&#44; &quot;young Gandhi&#44; in 1890 was influenced by those divisive thoughts prevalent then&quot;.  Alongside&#44; they also say this&#44; &quot;The experience of Gandhi in jail made him more sensitive about their condition  ..later Gandhi become stronger; he became less definitive in his expression of his prejudice&#44; and on several levels began seeing common points of equality&#44; in the jail of Johannesberg&#44; in his negative way of seeing&#44; there were no stubborn Africa inmates nor average Africans&quot;.,11631149_1 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,In the early 1950s&#44; a computer could execute only one program at a time. Each user had sole use of the computer and would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards and tape. The program would be loaded into the machine&#44; and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights. It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine&#44; and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the Universal Turing machine.[citation needed]  Later machines came with libraries of software&#44; which would be linked to a user&#39;s program to assist in operations such as input and output and generating computer code from human-readable symbolic code. This was the genesis of the modern-day operating system. However&#44; machines still ran a single job at a time. At Cambridge University in England the job queue was at one time a washing line from which tapes were hung with different colored clothes-pegs to indicate job-priority.,11621149_232 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open source software collaboration; typically all the underlying source code can be used&#44; freely modified&#44; and redistributed&#44; both commercially and non-commercially&#44; by anyone under licenses such as the GNU General Public License. Typically Linux is packaged in a format known as a Linux distribution for desktop and server use. Linux distributions include the Linux kernel and all of the supporting software required to run a complete system&#44; such as utilities and libraries&#44; the X Window System&#44; the GNOME and KDE desktop environments&#44; and the Apache HTTP Server. Commonly used applications with desktop Linux systems include the Mozilla Firefox web-browser&#44; the OpenOffice.org office application suite and the GIMP image editor.  The name &quot;Linux&quot; comes from the Linux kernel&#44; originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. The main supporting user space system tools and libraries from the GNU Project (announced in 1983 by Richard Stallman) are the basis for the Free Software Foundation&#39;s preferred name GNU/Linux.[,11481149_249 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,AT&amp;T and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix variants on the market at that time: BSD&#44; System V&#44; and Xenix. This became Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4).[9]  On September 4&#44; 1991&#44; Sun announced that it would replace its existing BSD-derived Unix&#44; SunOS 4&#44; with one based on SVR4. This was identified internally as SunOS 5&#44; but a new marketing name was introduced at the same time: Solaris 2.[10] While SunOS 4.1.x micro releases were retroactively named Solaris 1 by Sun&#44; the Solaris name is almost exclusively used to refer to the SVR4-derived SunOS 5.0 and later.he justification for this new &quot;overbrand&quot; was that it encompassed not only SunOS&#44; but also the OpenWindows graphical user interface and Open Network Computing (ONC) functionality. The SunOS minor version is included in the Solaris release number; for example&#44; Solaris 2.4 incorporated SunOS 5.4. After Solaris 2.6&#44; Sun dropped the &quot;2.&quot; from the number&#44; so Solaris 7 incorporates SunOS 5.7&#44; and the latest release SunOS 5.10 forms the core of Solaris 10.,114339074_1 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,Masturbation or exciting the sexual organs by oneself is a process indulged in commonly by boys and girls alike.  Scientifically&#44; it is established that there is no harm by this process.  Here the methods of self excitement of sexual organs by women are being discussed&#44; which give them unlimited sensual pleasure and also give them intense arousal&#44; whether she alone or with her partner.  If women did not arouse their sex organs by self&#44; there is a possibility that they are being deprived of adequate  excitement from the sex act.  On an average&#44; males indulge in masturbation from the age of 12-13.  As against this&#44; females start masturbation towards the end of puberty (from 13 to 19 years)&#44; but this matter remains so guarded and secretive that it is not allowed to be brought to the fore by anybody in any discussion also.  On attaining of complete puberty&#44; the issue of masturbation tends to be an open secret&#44; most people want it to be covered under veils&#44; but nowadays some youth are now breaking these restrictions and discussing the methods of masturbation and openly taking part in it.,11391149_0 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,An operating system consists of many parts. One of the most important components is the kernel&#44; which controls low-level processes that the average user usually cannot see: it controls how memory is read and written&#44; the order in which processes are executed&#44; how information is received and sent by devices like the monitor&#44; keyboard and mouse&#44; and deciding how to interpret information received by networks. The user interface is a component that interacts with the computer user directly&#44; allowing them to control and use programs. The user interface may be graphical with icons and a desktop&#44; or textual&#44; with a command line. Application programming interfaces provide services and code libraries that let applications developers write modular code reusing well defined programming sequences in user space libraries or in the operating system itself. Which features are considered part of the operating system is defined differently in various operating systems. For example&#44; Microsoft Windows considers its user interface to be part of the operating system&#44; while many versions of Linux do not.,113972463_76 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,In June 2007&#44; former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia&#44; along with Google&#44;[116] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are &quot;the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything.&quot; He also said that &quot;a generation of intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the Internet&quot; was being produced at universities. He complains that the web-based sources are discouraging students from learning from the more rare texts which are either found only on paper or are on subscription-only web sites. In the same article Jenny Fry (a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute) commented on academics who cite Wikipedia&#44; saying that: &quot;You cannot say children are intellectually lazy because they are using the Internet when academics are using search engines in their research. The difference is that they have more experience of being critical about what is retrieved and whether it is authoritative. Children need to be told how to use the Internet in a critical and appropriate way.,1137884_196 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,During the years of war&#44; one player who was always respected was Don Bradman&#44;who has always remained the greatest batsman&#44; according to his statistics. After the English team suffered defeat in 1932-33&#44;he was determined to bounce back and regain their status.The 20th century saw a development in test cricket.Before the second world war&#44; the West Indies&#44;India and New Zealand joined it. After the War&#44; Pakistan&#44; Sri Lanka and Bangladesh also joined this class.Due to Apartheid&#44; the players of South Africa were banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992.1963 brought out a new revolutin in cricket&#44; when the English County started the Limited overs-style of cricket.This was highly attractive because of the possibility of a definite result. This resulted in increase in the number of matches played.The first limited-overs international match was played in 1971. The international cricket council (ICC) studied the capabilities and organised limited-overs cricket world cup matches in 1975. In the 21 century&#44; The limited-overs style of matches found a new style of 20-20.,11271149_5 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,Most of the modern computer systems support graphical user interfaces (GUI)&#44; and often include them. In some computer systems&#44; such as the original implementations of Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS&#44; the GUI is integrated into the kernel.  While technically a graphical user interface is not an operating system service&#44; incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are modular&#44; separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX&#44; VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way. GNU/Linux and Mac OS X are also built this way. Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user-space&#44; however versions between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003&#39;s graphics drawing routines exist mostly in kernel space. Windows 9x had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel.,1120872_282 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,If I were a Jew born in Germany&#44; I would have been living in Germany and would have considered Germany as my mother country. Even if a fellow German would have threatened to kill me or imprison me in the darkest jail&#44; I would never give in to accepting something which in my opinion is not right.This is why I will wait for my Jewish brothers to join me in my stand against the wrongful things.I am&#44; in fact&#44; confident that everyone will regard me as a model&#44; and follow my actions.If one or all Jews accept the method stated here&#44;their living conditions will not deteriorate more than they have till now.If they succeed in tolerating the pain given to them&#44; they will attain internal power and happiness. This will be the first revolt against the actions of Hitler&#44; who has indulged in manslaughter and planned violence.If the minds of the Jews learn to tolerate pain voluntarily&#44; the day of death will also transform into a Thanksgiving Day or a joyous day.Just like Jihova gave his whole tribe in the hands of a tyrant. One who fears God does not feel the fear of death.,1109872_277 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,I have received many letters asking me to declare my stand on the persecution of the Jews in Germany and on Arab-Jews.  It is not like I can give my answer to this difficult question without any scruples.  My sympathy is with the Jews.  I know them closely from the time I was in South Africa&#44; and some of them have become my friends for life.  I came to know about the long persecution through these friends only.  They have been kept as untouchables in Jews religion.  But my sympathy will not take me away from reason.  Dfivision of a nation for the Jews does not appeal to me.  Is sanction there in the Bible and on what basis are they asking for Philippine in return?  Why do they&#44; who love other people in the world&#44;  not make home in the country where they are born and where they are earning a livelihood?  Palestine belongs to Arabs&#44; just as as England belongs to British and France to the French.  It is improper and finhuman for the Jews to rule over the Arabs.  Whatever is happening today in Palestine can not be proved right from any perspective of customs and good practices.,110619296_356 ,A9H4GEUPLSQ3M ,according to the decision in 1993 in supreme court advocates on record association vs. union of India the appointment of the judges of the supreme court and high court and the transfer of judges of the high courts is a process where the most capable person is to be appointed the opinion of the chief justice of India will be of primary importance he  will be the sole authority no appointment in the supreme court is made without his consent in circumstances of a conflict between constitutional authorities the chief justice of India shall represent the judiciary the president can tell the chief justice to reconsider his decision only on some reasonable grounds upon reconsideration the opinion of the chief justice of India shall be binding on the president though the C.J.I shall be surely taking opinions from the two senior most judges of the court in case of reconsideration the C.J.I shall again be bound seek opinion from the two senior most judges of the court he may in his discretion seek the opinions of other supreme court/high court judges but all such opinions shall always be in writing.,1106193079_185 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,For knowledge of the aforementioned organs and for diagnosis of the illness along with possibility or impossibility of treatment&#44; as per the treatises direct and other investigations are made on patients skeleton&#44; disposition&#44; tolerance&#44; measurements (length&#44; width&#44; weight&#44; etc. of each organ and of the body)&#44; habits&#44; food capacity&#44; exercising capacity&#44; age and also colour&#44; tone&#44; smell&#44; touch and sensory issues&#44; hearing&#44; eyes&#44; nose&#44; skin&#44; taste&#44; cleanliness&#44; manners&#44; remembrance capacity&#44; strength&#44; ennui&#44; gravity&#44; torpidity&#44; lightness&#44; coldness&#44; temperature&#44; softness&#44; toughness and other characteristics&#44; diet quality&#44; digestion and quantities&#44; thoughts&#44; illness and its past symptoms&#44; complications&#44; lustre&#44; dreams&#44; the messengers who came to ask to see the patient&#44; good and bad omens while entering the house of the patient&#44; influence of the planets&#44; thinking in natural and unnatural ways&#44; investigation has to be made.,1102872_291 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,The Former President of South Africa&#44; Nelson Mandela&#44; is a folower of Gandhiji.In 2003&#44;he unveiled a statue of Gandhi in Johannsberg in spite of strong opposition by Gandhijis critics.Bhana and Wahed have described events that happened during the unveiling of the statue&#44; in their book&#44; The Making Of A Political Reformer:Gandhi In South Africa&#44;1913-1914.In the Chapter&#44; Gandhijis gift to South Africa&#44;They write&#44;&quot;Gandhiji inspired active reformers in South Africa to end white superiority. This links his vies with that of Nelson Mandela.This means that what work was started by Gandhiji was ended by Nelson Mandela.They continue with descriptions of events that took place at the time of the unveiling of the statue of Gandhiji.Bhana and Wahed say&#44;&quot;Those people took the support of Gandhiji&#39;s views because they wanted to fulfil their desire to attain important political positions. Those views that declared them as those of a lower race and called them terrorists/revolutionaries&#44; did not help them to better their political standing.,109645247_189 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation&#44; such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct reference or description&#44; with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance&#44; much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication&#44; which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also&#44; some groups emerged that considered themselves above the Sharia and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.  For these and other reasons&#44; the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars&#44; such as Al-Ghazali&#44; helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it.,10891149_256 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Microsoft and IBM formed a joint project to create the next generation of graphical operating system. The result of the project was OS/2&#44; but Microsoft and IBM disagreed on many important issues and eventually separated. OS/2 remained an IBM project. Microsoft started[citation needed] to work on Windows NT. The OS/2 file system HPFS contained several important new features. When Microsoft created their new operating system&#44; they borrowed many of these concepts for NTFS.[6] Probably as a result of this common ancestry&#44; HPFS and NTFS share the same disk partition identification type code (07). Sharing an ID is unusual since there were dozens of available codes&#44; and other major file systems have their own code. FAT has more than nine (one each for FAT12&#44; FAT16&#44; FAT32&#44; etc.). Algorithms which identify the file system in a partition type 07 must perform additional checks. It is also clear that NTFS owes some of its architectural design to Files-11 used by VMS. This is hardly surprising since Dave Cutler was the main lead for both VMS and Windows NT.,108828539_112 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,It is useful to consider that environmental policy comprises two major terms: environment and policy. Environment primarily refers to the ecological dimension (ecosystems)&#44; but can also take account of social dimension (quality of life) and an economic dimension (resource management). [2] Policy can be defined as a &quot;course of action or principle adopted or proposed by a government&#44; party&#44; business or individual&quot; [3]. Thus&#44; environmental policy focuses on problems arising from human impact on the environment&#44; which retroacts onto human society by having a (negative) impact on human values such as good health or the &#39;clean and green&#39; environment.    Environmental issues generally addressed by environmental policy include (but are not limited to) air and water pollution&#44; waste management&#44; ecosystem management&#44; biodiversity protection&#44; and the protection of natural resources&#44; wildlife and endangered species. Relatively recently&#44; environmental policy has also attended to the communication of environmental issues,10841149_263 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,The FAT file system does not contain mechanisms which prevent newly written files from becoming scattered across the partition.[20] Other file systems&#44; like HPFS&#44; use free space bitmaps that indicate used and available clusters&#44; which could then be quickly looked up in order to find free contiguous areas (improved in exFAT). Another solution is the linkage of all free clusters into one or more lists (as is done in Unix file systems). Instead&#44; the FAT has to be scanned as an array to find free clusters&#44; which can lead to performance penalties with large disks.  In fact&#44; computing free disk space on FAT is one of the most resource intensive operations&#44; as it requires reading the entire FAT linearly. A possible justification suggested by Microsoft&#39;s Raymond Chen for limiting the maximum size of FAT32 partitions created on Windows was the time required to perform a &quot;DIR&quot; operation&#44; which always displays the free disk space as the last line.[16] Displaying this line took longer and longer as the number of clusters increased.,108147017_291 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,According to the WTO&#44; in 2009 France was the world&#39;s sixth-largest exporter and the fourth-largest importer of manufactured goods.[144] In 2008&#44; France was the third-largest recipient of foreign direct investment among OECD countries at $117.9 billion&#44; ranking behind Luxembourg (where foreign direct investment was essentially monetary transfers to banks located in that country) and the United States ($316.1 billion)&#44; but above the United Kingdom ($96.9 billion)&#44; Germany ($24.9 billion)&#44; or Japan ($24.4 billion).[145][146] In the same year&#44; French companies invested $220 billion outside of France&#44; ranking France as the second most important outward direct investor in the OECD&#44; behind the United States ($311.8 billion)&#44; and ahead of the United Kingdom ($111.4 billion)&#44; Japan ($128 billion) and Germany ($156.5 billion).[145][146] With 39 of the 500 biggest companies of the world in 2010&#44; Frances ranks 4th in the Fortune Global 500&#44; behind the USA&#44; Japan and China&#44; but ahead of Germany and the UK.,10721762_237 ,A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 ,God is most often conceived of as the supernatural creator and overseer of the universe. Theologians have ascribed a variety of attributes to the many different conceptions of God. The most common among these include omniscience (infinite knowledge)&#44; omnipotence (unlimited power)&#44; omnipresence (present everywhere)&#44; omnibenevolence (perfect goodness)&#44; divine simplicity&#44; and eternal and necessary existence.    God has also been conceived as being incorporeal (immaterial)&#44; a personal being&#44; the source of all moral obligation&#44; and the &quot;greatest conceivable existent&quot;.[1] These attributes were all supported to varying degrees by the early Jewish&#44; Christian and Muslim theologian philosophers&#44; including Maimonides&#44;[2] Augustine of Hippo&#44;[2] and Al-Ghazali&#44;[3] respectively. Many notable medieval philosophers and modern philosophers developed arguments for the existence of God.[3] Many notable philosophers and intellectuals have&#44; in contrast&#44; developed arguments against the existence of God.,106681232_23 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,God is most often conceived of as the supernatural creator and overseer of the universe.

The term Guoyu is relatively rarely used in Mainland China&#44; because declaring a Beijing-dialect-based standard to be the national language would be deemed unfair to other Chinese dialects and ethnic minorities.[citation needed] The term Putonghua (common speech)&#44; on the contrary&#44; implies nothing more than the notion of a lingua franca. However&#44; the term Guoyu does persist among many older Mainland Chinese&#44; and it is common in U.S. Chinese communities&#44; even among Mainlanders. Some in Taiwan&#44; especially proponents of Taiwan independence&#44; also object to the term Guoyu to refer to standardized Mandarin&#44; on the grounds that the &quot;nation&quot; referred to in the name of the language is China and that Taiwan is or should be independent. They prefer to refer to Mandarin with the terms &quot;Beijing dialect&quot; or Zhongwen (writing of China). Those hold other positions on the political spectrum in Taiwan display different views.,106447017_298 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,he unemployment rate decreased from 9% in 2006 to 7% in 2008 but remains one of the highest in Europe.[167][168] In June 2009&#44; the unemployment rate for France was 9.4%.[169] Shorter working hours and the reluctance to reform the labour market are mentioned as weak spots of the French economy in the view of the right&#44; when the left mentions the lack of government policies fostering social justice. Liberal economists have stressed repeatedly over the years that the main issue of the French economy is an issue of structural reforms&#44; in order to increase the size of the working population in the overall population&#44; reduce the taxes&#39; level and the administrative burden.  Keynesian economists have different answers to the unemployment issue&#44; and their theories led to the 35-hour workweek law in the early 2000s&#44; which turned out to be a failure in reducing unemployment. Afterwards&#44; between 2004 and 2008&#44; the Government made some supply-oriented reforms to combat unemployment but met with fierce resistance&#44;,105528539_113 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,Often&#44; several instruments are combined in an instrument mix formulated to address a certain environmental problem. Since environmental issues often have many different aspects&#44; several policy instruments may be needed to adequately address each one. Furthermore&#44; instrument mixes may allow firms greater flexibility in finding ways to comply with government policy while reducing the uncertainty in the cost of doing so. However&#44; instrument mixes must be carefully formulated so that the individual measures within them do not undermine each other or create a rigid and cost-ineffective compliance framework. Also&#44; overlapping instruments lead to unnecessary administrative costs&#44; making implementation of environmental policies more costly than necessary.In order to help governments realize their environmental policy goals&#44; the OECD Environment Directorate studies and collects data on the efficiency of the environmental instruments governments use to achieve their goals as well as their consequences for other policies.,10541149_22 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,This design would have worked well for compatibility&#44; if application programs had only used MS-DOS services to perform device I/O&#44; and indeed the same design philosophy is embodied in Windows NT (see Hardware Abstraction Layer). However&#44; in MS-DOS&#39;s early days&#44; the greater speed attainable by programs through direct control of hardware was of particular importance&#44; especially for games&#44; which often pushed the limits of their contemporary hardware. Very soon an IBM-compatible architecture became the goal&#44; and before long all 8086-family computers closely emulated IBM&#39;s hardware&#44; and only a single version of MS-DOS for a fixed hardware platform was needed for the market. This version is the version of MS-DOS that is discussed here&#44; as the dozens of other OEM versions of &quot;MS-DOS&quot; were only relevant to the systems they were designed for&#44; and in any case were very similar in function and capability to the same-numbered standard version for the IBM PC&#44; with a few notable exceptions.,10531149_162 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Windows Vista is an operating system released in several variations developed by Microsoft for use on personal computers&#44; including home and business desktops&#44; laptops&#44; tablet PCs&#44; and media center PCs. Prior to its announcement on July 22&#44; 2005&#44; Windows Vista was known by its codename &quot;Longhorn.&quot;[4] Development was completed on November 8&#44; 2006; over the following three months it was released in stages to computer hardware and software manufacturers&#44; business customers&#44; and retail channels. On January 30&#44; 2007&#44; it was released worldwide&#44;[5] and was made available for purchase and download from Microsoft&#39;s website.[6] The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor&#44; Windows XP&#44; the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems. It was succeeded by Windows 7 which was released to manufacturing on July 22&#44; 2009&#44; and for the general public on October 22&#44; 2009.,10471149_261 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,FAT (also sometimes incorrectly and inappropriately known as FAT64) is an incompatible replacement for FAT file systems that was introduced with Windows Embedded CE 6.0. It is intended to be used on flash drives&#44; where FAT is used today. Microsoft has offered a hotfix to add support for exFAT to Windows XP&#44;[24] while Windows Vista Service Pack 1 added exFAT support to Windows Vista.[25] exFAT introduces a free space bitmap allowing faster space allocation and faster deletes&#44; support for files up to 264 bytes (16777216 TB)&#44; larger cluster sizes (up to 32 MB in the first implementation)&#44; an extensible directory structure and name hashes for filenames for faster comparisons. It does not have short 8.3 filenames anymore. It does not appear to have security ACLs or file system journaling like NTFS&#44; though device manufacturers can choose to implement simplified support for transactions (backup file allocation table used for the write operations&#44; primary FAT for storing last known good allocation table).,104081232_13 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The Garuda Purana is a Vaishnava Purana. The others in this group are Vishnu Purana&#44; Narada Purana&#44; Bhagavata Purana&#44; Padma Purana and Varaha Purana.  The Garuda Purana has nineteen thousand shlokas(lines). It is a medium-sized Purana. The Skanda Purana&#44; for example&#44; has eighty-one thousand shlokas. And the Markandeya Purana only nine thousand. The thousand shlokas of the Garuda Purana are divided into two parts&#44; a purva khanda (first part) and an uttara khanda (subsequent part). Each khanda has several chapters (adhyaya). The purva khanda is much longer&#44; it has two hundred and thirty-four chapters. The Uttara khanda has only forty-five.  The latter half of this Purana deals with life after death. The followers of the eternal Vedas&#44; addressed as &quot;Hindus&quot; of India generally read this Purana while cremating the physically dead bodies of departed atmaas/souls. This has given great importance to the origin of Garuda. There are nineteen thousand verses describing the ways to the Lord.,103684960_184 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,Sri Brahmam started as usual on the tour of the country&#44; visited pilgrimage places&#44; was taking rest in a village near Nandyala for food&#44; felt thirsty&#44; stood before the house of a goldsmith and requested for water.

Sri Brahmam did not accept and again asked for water.  The goldsmith got angry&#44; brought molten metal and asked him to drink it.  Without a word Sri Brahmam drank that fluid of the metal.  Seeing this the goldsmith got frightened&#44; said that he committed a mistake and requested for pardon.  To that Sri Brahmam said&#44; &quot;I am not angry with anybody; I am angry only with lack of knowledge&quot;.  Thereafter&#44; on the request of the goldsmith&#44; he accepted his services&#44; started again and visited the worship places in the Kurnool district&#44; and reached Nandyala.  The people of Nandyala,10061149_252 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,As of Windows Vista&#44; applications can use Transactional NTFS to group changes to files together into a transaction. The transaction will guarantee that all changes happen&#44; or none of them do&#44; and it will guarantee that applications outside the transaction will not see the changes until they are committed.[24]  It uses the similar techniques as those used for Volume Shadow Copies (i.e. copy-on-write) to ensure that overwritten data can be safely rolled back&#44; and a CLFS log to mark the transactions that have still not been committed&#44; or those that have been committed but still not fully applied (in case of system crash during a commit by one of the participants).  Transactional NTFS does not restrict transactions to just the local NTFS volume&#44; but also includes other transactional data or operations in other locations such as data stored in separate volumes&#44; the local registry&#44; or SQL databases&#44; or the current states of system services or remote services.,100372463_99 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Though the English Wikipedia reached 3 million articles in August 2009&#44; the growth of the edition&#44; in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors&#44; appeared to have flattened off around early 2007.[36] In July 2007&#44; about 2&#44;200 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia; as of August 2009&#44; that average is 1&#44;300. A team led by Ed H.

In the early 1990s a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium&#44; the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative&#44; which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification administered by The Open Group. Starting in 1998 the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group&#44; to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification.    In an effort towards compatibility&#44; in 1999 several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4&#39;s Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.,992884_187 ,A3IHCT015XNNJK ,For &quot;Cricket&quot; word&#44; the word count is believed as a source. In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598&#44; it is called creckett. It met between Middle-age business connection&#44; south-est England and county of flanders&#44; which supposed to be Duchy of Burgundy. This name supposed to be derived from Krik(-e) of Middle Dutch or in old English Kris or Krise which means stick (Baisakhi in Hindi). That sounds like Old French word Criquet which means a kind of stick or club. In Samuel johnson&#39;s directory&#44; he described cricket as &quot;cryce&quot; which means Saskon-A Stick. One more probable evidence is middle dutch word krickstoel which means - a long beneath stul which is used in church for resting knee&#44; that looks like old age long two wicket and stumps. Bonn University&#39;s europian language expert Heiner gillmeister believes that Cricket is derived for middle dutch Hockey - met de (krik ket)sen means along with back side of stick.,9861149_38 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphical&#44; audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers&#44; such as the Commodore 64&#44; and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The best selling model&#44; the Amiga 500&#44; was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe. In North America success was more modest. The Amiga went on to sell approximately six million units.[1] Second generation Amiga systems (A1200 and A4000) were released in 1992. However&#44; failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems and poor marketing meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms&#44; such as the game consoles and IBM PC compatibles.,97913739_76 ,A3J1PP96QX14U0 ,he Rigvedic hymns are dedicated to various deities&#44; chief of whom are Indra&#44; a heroic god praised for having slain his enemy Vrtra; Agni&#44; the sacrificial fire; and Soma&#44; the sacred potion or the plant it is made from. Equally prominent gods are the Adityas or Asura gods MitraVaruna and Ushas (the dawn). Also invoked are Savitr&#44; Vishnu&#44; Rudra&#44; Pushan&#44; Brihaspati or Brahmanaspati&#44; as well as deified natural phenomena such as Dyaus Pita (the shining sky&#44; Father Heaven )&#44; Prithivi (the earth&#44; Mother Earth)&#44; Surya (the sun god)&#44; Vayu or Vata (the wind)&#44; Apas (the waters)&#44; Parjanya (the thunder and rain)&#44; Vac (the word)&#44; many rivers (notably the Sapta Sindhu&#44; and the Sarasvati River). The Adityas&#44; Vasus&#44; Rudras&#44; Sadhyas&#44; Ashvins&#44; Maruts&#44; Rbhus&#44; and the Vishvadevas (&quot;all-gods&quot;) as well as the &quot;thirty-three gods&quot; are the groups of deities mentioned.,97726300_70 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,The emission temperature of infrared radiation depends on the intensity&#44; from the upper layers of the atmosphere longwave radiation is emitted&#44; and from the lower layers&#44; this is less.  Most of the radiation emitted from the upper layers goes into the space&#44; whereas the radiation from the lower layers enters the atmosphere again and gets absorbed by it.  In this way&#44; the green house effect depends on the rate of decrease of temperature with the height.  If the temperature decrease rate is less green house effect is less and vice versa.  Theories and models both indicate that due to the worming effect&#44; the decrease in temperature as we go up is reduced.  A negative lapse rate feedback is produced and this makes the green house effect weak.  Calculation of the rate of change of temperature with height is very subtle and sensitive to tiny changes&#44; and so it is very difficult to find out whether the model represents the reality or not.,97328539_44 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,Other common soil pollutants are chlorinated hydrocarbons&#44; heavy metals (like Chromium&#44; Cadmium -- which comes from reusable batteries&#44; and lead -- from paints&#44; aviation fuel&#44; and in some countries&#44; gasoline&#44; MTBE&#44; Zinc&#44; Arsenic)&#44; and Benzene.  In 2001&#44; the press reports were compiled and published as a book by the title &quot;Fateful Harvest&quot;&#44; in which are given the extents of soil pollution caused by different minerals&#44; and recyclable byproducts of industries.  City administrations are the sources of landfills with such wastes.  Many chemicals enter the soil and affect the fertility of the land&#44; particularly the unscientific disposal of intoxicating drugs&#44; or pre -1970 landfills which were then filled in European Union and America under minimal controls.  For example&#44; there are many unnatural consequences of a common chemical called plychlorinated dibenzodioxins&#44; commonly called TCDD.,9721149_301 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,In 2003&#44; the SCO Group started legal action against various users and vendors of Linux. SCO had alleged that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code now owned by The SCO Group. Other allegations included trade-secret violations by IBM&#44; or contract violations by former Santa Cruz customers who had since converted to Linux. However&#44; Novell disputed the SCO Group&#39;s claim to hold copyright on the UNIX source base. According to Novell&#44; SCO (and hence the SCO Group) are effectively franchise operators for Novell&#44; which also retained the core copyrights&#44; veto rights over future licensing activities of SCO&#44; and 95% of the licensing revenue. The SCO Group disagreed with this&#44; and the dispute resulted in the SCO v. Novell lawsuit. On August 10&#44; 2007&#44; a major portion of the case was decided in Novell&#39;s favor (that Novell had the copyright to UNIX&#44; and that the SCO Group had improperly kept money that was due to Novell).,972872_275 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,Keeping a double stand like this on the issue of Indian partition&#44; Gandhi opened the areas of perceptions from both Hindus and Muslims.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah and contemporary Pakistanis accused Gandhi of undermining the political rights of the Muslims.  Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his colleagues blamed Gandhi and accused that he was coaxing the Muslims&#44; that he was indifferent to the crimes committed against the Hindus&#44; and that he had already accepted the formation of Pakistan (though he publicly announced that he may be cut into two pieces before partition).  This is even today politically debatable&#44; as Pakistani-American historian Ayesha Jalal gives the logic that Gandhi and Congress were not willing to share power with Muslim League.  Other Hindu nationalist and political leader Pravin Togadia also considers this issue in the leadership of Gandhi&#44; and also suggests that partition happened because of the extreme weakness of his group.,97145708_48 ,A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST ,In this position the woman is better facing the man. This position allows much more closeness and is good for those couples who are more interested in kissing during the foreplay. In this position the man sits on a bed or in a similar place with his legs lowered to the ground. The woman  while facing the man then takes the vagina over the man&#39;s penis and spreads her legs. The woman&#39;s hands also take support on the man&#39;s body. In this position the man&#44; During the foreplay&#44; either can bring his hands backwards to take support or can also put them on the woman&#39;s buttocks or the waist to increase the intensity and speed of his strokes. Unfortunately&#44; the position shown in the picture is not as much effective for strokes (as shown in the ratings). Use a stool or a chair to enjoy this position to the fullest. In this the woman has ample opportunities to rest her legs. One can also sit conveniently to enjoy the position even more.,96528539_104 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,International calamities like the ship disaster of oil tanker ship&#44; Amoco Cadiz in 1978 on the shores of Brittany&#44; and Bhopal disaster in 1984 have shown the universality of such happenings&#44; and there is a need to try and address them in a decisive manner.  The boundariless nature of space and oceans has definitely increased the pollution on earth at the planetary level&#44; the issue of global worming is also related to this.  Very recently&#44; one word&#44; Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP) has come into vogue&#44; which describes a special group among chemicals. like PBDE and PFC.  For want of enough practical data the effect of this group of chemicals is not understood well.  But still its existence has come to light in ecological regions like the Arctic region which are away from the industrial processes&#44; which reveal in comparatively short time existence of such spread out biological groups of chemicals after widespread use.,9621149_234 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open source software. Linux is not the only such operating system&#44; although it is by far the most widely used.[44] Some free and open source software licenses are based on the principle of copyleft&#44; a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most common free software license&#44; the GNU GPL&#44; is a form of copyleft&#44; and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the GNU project.  Linux based distributions are intended by developers for interoperability with other operating systems and established computing standards. Linux systems adhere to POSIX&#44;[45] SUS&#44;[46] ISO&#44; and ANSI standards where possible&#44; although to date only one Linux distribution has been POSIX.1 certified&#44; Linux-FT.,95745708_109 ,A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST ,This position is not similar to anal sex. In this position the man inserts his penis into the woman&#39;s vagina from the rear. The woman&#39;s face in this position is away from the man&#39;s face and the woman lies on her stomach. In this position she spreads her legs. By doing this the vagina opens up in a clear view. Meanwhile the man inserts the penis into her vagina. In this position&#44; the outer walls of the gets a head on push and for this reason one can enjoy the g spot sex in ecstasy.This position enables a deeper penetration and longer strokes which is why it is not recommended for pregnant women. This position can be divided into two parts. The first in which the woman lies down and spreads her legs enabling a deeper penetration and the other in which the woman lies down with legs sticking closer. This helps enjoy g sex immensly. The only drawback in this position is that it does not allow eye contact or gives any scope to kiss.,9562646_23 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,There are many types of mobile phones&#44; starting from the basic phone to the metamorphised phone like the musical phone and camera phone and smartphone. Nokia 9000 Communicator was the first smartphone which came in 1996&#44; and in which PDA technology was incorporated to face the then competition from other mobile phones. Many features to use miniaturisation and improved processing capability of the microchip were added&#44; expanded the concept of smartphone &#44; and a superior smartphone of five years ago&#44; is today a standard phone.  For a market segement&#44; many series of phones were introduced&#44; like RIM Blackberry centred / focussing on the business of need of email for the corporate customers; Musical phones of Sony Ericman&#39;s Walkman Seriesand camera phones of Cybershot Series; Multimedia phones of Nokia&#39;s N-Series; and Apple iPhone&#44; which presents all the specialities of web usage and multimedia technology.,95445247_57 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The word love can refer to a variety of different feelings&#44; states&#44; and attitudes&#44; ranging from generic pleasure (&quot;I loved that meal&quot;) to intense interpersonal attraction (&quot;I love my wife&quot;). &quot;Love&quot; can also refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of romantic love&#44; to the sexual love of eros (cf. Greek words for love)&#44; to the emotional closeness of familial love&#44; or to the platonic love that defines friendship&#44;[3] to the profound oneness or devotion of religious love. [4] This diversity of uses and meanings&#44; combined with the complexity of the feelings involved&#44; makes love unusually difficult to consistently define&#44; even compared to other emotional states.  Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and&#44; owing to its central psychological importance&#44; is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.,9512646_55 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,For example&#44; in Jamaica&#44; a AT&amp;T customer opted for an international service. Additional payment of 65 per minute can be made&#44; whereas a B-Mobile (Jamaica) customer has to pay for an equivalent international service /bin/sh.20 for every minute.  Some service providers focus on international sales&#44; whereas some others on regional sales.  For example&#44; The National Phone Company of Jamaica&#44; Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) Company&#39;s position is that the same B-phone customers spend less on local calls and more on international calls.  This difference is mainly because of the currency conversion&#44; because SIM card is purchased in local currency.  In America&#44; there is no competition for such services because some prominent service providers do not offer settle-when-you-quit service.  [settlement-when-you-quit requirements Reference&#44; T-Mobile Report&#44; Offer to Verizon One&#44; AT&amp;T not till 12/2008],95155057_206 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Economic reforms included a unified modern currency based on the yen&#44; banking&#44; commercial and tax laws&#44; stock exchanges&#44; and a communications network. Establishment of a modern institutional framework conducive to an advanced capitalist economy took time but was completed by the 1890s. By this time&#44; the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process&#44; primarily for budgetary reasons. Many of the former daimyo&#44; whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum&#44; benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries.  The government was initially involved in economic modernization&#44; providing a number of &quot;model factories&quot; to facilitate the transition to the modern period. After the first twenty years of the Meiji period&#44; the industrial economy expanded rapidly until about 1920 with inputs of advanced Western technology and large private investments.,9492646_5 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,In 1908&#44; a wireless telephone was patented by Nathan B. Stubblefield Murray&#44; Kentuckey.  In this patent&#44; they represented the case of &quot;uses of radio telephone&quot;&#44; and not for the straight cellular telephone as understood now.  In 1947 sale of base stations of mobile phones was started by the engineers of the Bell Laboratories of AT&amp;T and during the decade of 1960 Bell Laboratories further improved this.  There is a long and detailed history for the radio phone which extends upto the introduction and total exhibition of radio telephony by Reginald Fassendon&#44; during the second world war and in the decade of 1950s&#44; usage of radio telephonic link in public services and army&#44; whereas hand cellular radio instruments&#44; as we know them today&#44; are available after 1973&#44; American Patent No. 3449750 was given for the first wireless phone to George Sweygert&#44; Ohio&#44; Uclid on 10 June 1969.,9451149_136 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,Many types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are also available for Linux. Commonly&#44; either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system&#44; or that application will have a version that works on Linux (such as Skype). Furthermore&#44; the Wine project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. CrossOver is a proprietary solution based on the open source Wine project that supports running Windows versions of Microsoft Office&#44; Intuit applications such as Quicken and QuickBooks&#44; Adobe Photoshop versions through CS2&#44; and many popular games such as World of Warcraft and Team Fortress 2. In other cases&#44; where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as desktop publishing[57] and professional audio&#44;[58][59][60] there is equivalent software available on Linux.,94372463_126 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Wikipedia receives between 25&#44;000 and 60&#44;000 page requests per second&#44; depending on time of day.[155] Page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Squid caching servers.[156] Further statistics are available based on a publicly available 3-months Wikipedia access trace.[157] Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software&#44; which in turn pass the request to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested&#44; performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further&#44; rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated&#44; allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. Two larger clusters in the Netherlands and Korea now handle much of Wikipedia&#39;s traffic load.,93745247_98 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,In both mainland China and Taiwan&#44; the use of Mandarin as the medium of instruction in the educational system and in the media has contributed to the spread of Mandarin. As a result&#44; Mandarin is now spoken fluently by most people in mainland China and Taiwan.  In Hong Kong and Macau&#44; which are now special administrative regions of the People&#39;s Republic of China&#44; Standard Cantonese has been the primary language spoken by the majority of the population&#44; due to historical and linguistic reasons. After Hong Kong&#39;s handover from Britain and Macau&#39;s handover from Portugal&#44; Mandarin has become only slightly more understood (but still not widely spoken) and is used by the governments of the two territories to communicate with the Central People&#39;s Government of the PRC. Cantonese remains the official government language of Hong Kong and Macau when not communicating with mainland China.,929872_289 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,Gandhijis earlier articles from South Africa have been highly debated. On 7th March 1908&#44; Gandhiji&#44; in the &quot;Indian Opinion&quot;&#44; wrote about his imprisonment in South Africa. He wrote that &quot;It seems an uncivilized rule&#44; moreso when one is a prisoner.Prisoners live difficult&#44; dirty lives like animals.&quot; In 1903&#44; He wrote&#44; &quot;I believe that I also belong to a pure race&#44; as they do.But i agree that the whites in South Africa should be considered as a higher race.&quot; In his days in South Africa&#44; Gandhiji often opposed the unfair treatment of Indians by the whites&#44; and he describes this as&#44;&quot;It is definitely better than the Kaffirs.&quot;It is worth considering that the meaning of Kaffirs in Gandhiji&#39;s times was quite different than its meaning today.Gandhiji&#44; in his articles&#44; has urged some people in declaring themselves as a higher race.,9278066_122 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,The song was featured in a Zune advertisement in 2006 and again in an iPod advertisement in 2007.    An 18-year-old British student&#44; Nick Haley&#44; used the song in a homemade 30-second commercial for the iPod touch that he created and then posted on the video sharing site YouTube on September 11&#44; 2007. Creative executives from Apple&#39;s advertising agency&#44; TBWA\Chiat\Day&#44; saw Haley&#39;s creation&#44; contacted him and enlisted him to remake it as a broadcast version. The spot began airing in the U.S. on October 28&#44; 2007.An unofficial fan-produced video received an overwhelmingly large number of views on YouTube. It was removed from the YouTube most-viewed list for a short time pending an investigation by YouTube&#44; but was then reinstated. On March 15&#44; 2008 the poster of this fan video removed it from YouTube&#44; though it remained on the most-viewed list for a short time afterwards,92772463_40 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The &quot;History&quot; page attached to each article records every single past revision of the article&#44; though a revision with libelous content&#44; criminal threats or copyright infringements may be removed afterwards.[50][51] This feature makes it easy to compare old and new versions&#44; undo changes that an editor considers undesirable&#44; or restore lost content. The &quot;Discussion&quot; pages associated with each article are used to coordinate work among multiple editors.[52] Regular contributors often maintain a &quot;watchlist&quot; of articles of interest to them&#44; so that they can easily keep tabs on all recent changes to those articles. Computer programs called Internet bots have been used widely to remove vandalism as soon as it was made&#44;[16] to correct common misspellings and stylistic issues&#44; or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.,9271762_245 ,A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 ,There are many philosophical issues concerning the existence of God. Some definitions of God are sometimes nonspecific&#44; while other definitions can be self-contradictory. Arguments for the existence of God typically include metaphysical&#44; empirical&#44; inductive&#44; and subjective types&#44; while others revolve around perceived holes in evolutionary theory and order and complexity in the world. Arguments against the existence of God typically include empirical&#44; deductive&#44; and inductive types. Conclusions reached include: &quot;God does not exist&quot; (strong atheism); &quot;God almost certainly does not exist&quot;[17] (de facto atheism); &quot;no one knows whether God exists&quot; (agnosticism); &quot;God exists&#44; but this cannot be proven or disproven&quot; (weak theism); and &quot;God exists and this can be proven&quot; (strong theism). There are numerous variations on these positions.,92384960_179 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The story according to the priests is that when the sage Agastya compleated his uttara desha yatra and started dakshina desha yatra he found the beautiful and pleasent place called yaganti( Nekanti-i have seen)and thought to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site . while roaming around caves one of the caves was found to have a very old statue of Lord Vishnu . After all the yagna&#44; homa and poojas he found that the statue really contains a small defect as broken nail on the foot thumb finger. To seek an explanation he prayed to Shiva and Shiva explained that at this place which contains natural springs and nature only I can be worshipped. Then the sage Agastya asked a boom to Shiva to reside in this place for eternity with Mother Parvathi. So this place is called as Umamahesware (ume: parvathi&#44; maheswara: shiva) temple. The shrine contains the statue of Shiva and Parvathi on a single stone.,92147017_292 ,A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 ,France is the world&#39;s sixth-largest agricultural producer and the second-largest agricultural exporter&#44; after the United States[8]. However&#44; the destination of 70% of its exports are other EU member states and many poor African countries (including its former colonies) which face serious food shortage. Wheat&#44; beef&#44; pork&#44; poultry&#44; and dairy products are the principal exports. The United States&#44; although the second-largest exporter to France&#44; faces stiff competition from domestic production&#44; other EU member states&#44; and third world countries. U.S. agricultural exports to France&#44; totalling some $600 million annually&#44; consist primarily of soybeans and products&#44; feeds and fodders&#44; seafood&#44; and consumer oriented products&#44; especially snack foods and nuts.

Madeleine (Meera Behan)who was the daughter of a British Naval officer spent most her life time as a follower of Gandhi in India.,91053283_484 ,A3J1PP96QX14U0 ,Suffering from the Great Depression&#44; the harsh peace conditions dictated by the Treaty of Versailles&#44; and a long succession of more or less unstable governments&#44; the people of Germany increasingly lacked identification with their political system and the &quot;Establishment Parties&quot; in their parliamentary democracy. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing (monarchist&#44; vlkisch&#44; and Nazi) Dolchstolegende&#44; which promoted the view that Germany had lost World War I because of the efforts and influence of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The top brass of the Weimar government was accused of betraying the German Nation by signing the Versailles Treaty&#44; while the radical left-wing communists&#44; such as the Spartacist League&#44; had wanted a revolution to abolish &quot;capitalist rule&quot; in favour of a Rterepublik&#44; and were also targeted.,90547017_297 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,With an estimated population of 65.4 million people (as of 1 Jan. 2010)&#44;[7] France is the 20th most populous country in the world. In 2003&#44; France&#39;s natural population growth (excluding immigration) was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union. In 2004&#44; population growth was 0.68% and then in 2005 birth and fertility rates continued to increase. The natural increase of births over deaths rose to 299&#44;800 in 2006. The total fertility rate rose to 2.02 in 2008&#44;[7] from 1.88 in 2002.[175]  The largest cities in France&#44; in terms of metropolitan area population&#44; are Paris (11&#44;769&#44;433)&#44; Lyon (1&#44;748&#44;271)&#44; Marseille (1&#44;605&#44;000)&#44; Lille (1&#44;164&#44;716)&#44; Nice (1&#44;197&#44;751)&#44; Toulouse (1&#44;102&#44;882)&#44; Bordeaux (999&#44;149)&#44; Nantes (804&#44;000) and Strasbourg (639&#44;000).,9031149_6 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,The operating system was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0&#44; with a desktop-oriented version (Mac OS X v10.0) following in March 2001. Since then&#44; six more distinct &quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; editions of Mac OS X have been released&#44; the most recent being Mac OS X v10.6&#44; which was first made available on August 28&#44; 2009. Releases of Mac OS X are named after big cats; the current version of Mac OS X is &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;.  The server edition&#44; Mac OS X Server&#44; is architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart but usually runs on Apple&#39;s line of Macintosh server hardware. Mac OS X Server includes work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services&#44; including a mail transfer agent&#44; a Samba server&#44; an LDAP server&#44; a domain name server&#44; and others.,90081232_10 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,n the twenty-first incarnation&#44; Vishnu became a Buddha . Buddha&#39;s purpose of the birth was to delude asuras. The Sri Vaishnavas do not believe that Buddha was Vishnu&#39;s incarnation&#44; but Madhvas believe that Buddha was indeed Vishnu&#39;s incarnation. In the Brahmanda purana it is said (source wiki) &quot;In order to delude the demons&#44; he (Lord Buddha) was present in the form of a child on the way while the foolish Jina (a demon)&#44; imagined him to be his son. Later on&#44; Lord Sri Hari (as avatara-buddha) expertly deluded Jina and other demons by his strong words of non-violence.&quot;  The twenty-second incarnation is yet to come. And Vishnu will come. Vishnu will be born as Kalki&#44; so as to destroy evil in the world and restore righteousness&quot;.  There have been several other incarnations of Vishnu. But the ones mentioned above are the major ones.,88928539_63 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,The environment in China has traditionally been neglected as the country concentrates on its rise as an economic power. Despite a recent interest in environmental reform&#44; pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in 30 cities and 78 counties&#44; the Ministry of Health says.[1] Only 1 percent of the countrys 560 million city inhabitants (2007) breathe air deemed safe by the European Union. Chinese industry scores very poorly in energy efficiency. Chinese steel factories use one-fifth more energy per ton than the international average. Cement needs 45 percent more power&#44; and ethylene needs 70 percent more than average&#44; the World Bank says. A lot of the pollution in China nowadays is generated for producing the cheap products that fill stores in the United States and Europe. However&#44; the major victim of this pollution is the Chinese population itself.,88850557_81 ,A2U97186TBAC51 ,Children living in the cities which are more polluted in the world are suffering from the diseases like asthma and pneumonia and some kind of lung illness. In the cities like New Delhi&#44; India government imposed rules to only use Environmental gas for buses to reduce the pollution and to aware the young citizens. world health organization has declared clean air act in 1980 in the countries like Sudan&#44; magnolia  and Indonesia which are Low economy countries and most of the population is poor with huge populations. But in 2002 minimum 146 million Americans were living in those places which didn&#39;t followed at least one of the rules of 1998&#39;s National environment act. Those areas are effected with Ozone&#44; Sulfur dioxide&#44; nitrogen dioxide&#44; carbon monoxide&#44; and citrate. Children are effected with this Because most of the time children spends time out.,8871149_235 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,In many cities and regions&#44; local associations known as Linux Users Groups (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations&#44; training&#44; technical support&#44; and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open source projects have IRC chatrooms or newsgroups. Online forums are another means for support&#44; with notable examples being LinuxQuestions.org and the Gentoo forums. Linux distributions host mailing lists; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.  There are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print magazines on Linux often include cover disks including software or even complete Linux distributions,88763528_49 ,A3V7G0CFREWGTP ,point&#44; pole&#44; police&#44; policy&#44; politics&#44; poling&#44; polytechnics&#44;  popular&#44; port&#44; portion&#44; positive&#44; post&#44; posting&#44; postmortem&#44;  potency&#44; power&#44; particles&#44; practice&#44; player&#44; precaution&#44; preference&#44; pregnant&#44; preliminary&#44; present&#44; president&#44;   process&#44; prize&#44; primary&#44; principal&#44; printing press&#44; private&#44; probation&#44; problem&#44; procedure&#44; producer&#44; profit&#44; progress report&#44; project&#44; promissory note&#44; promotion&#44; proper&#44; profit&#44; proprietor&#44; prosecutor&#44; protocol&#44; psychiatrist&#44; public garden&#44; publisher&#44; puncture&#44; punishment&#44; purpose&#44; puzzle&#44; pounce&#44; pencil&#44; plug&#44; pump&#44; qualification&#44; quality&#44; quarter&#44; quarry&#44; question&#44; quorum&#44; quota&#44; quotation,8861149_236 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Many types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are also available for Linux. Commonly&#44; either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system&#44; or that application will have a version that works on Linux (such as Skype). Furthermore&#44; the Wine project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. CrossOver is a proprietary solution based on the open source Wine project that supports running Windows versions of Microsoft Office&#44; Intuit applications such as Quicken and QuickBooks&#44; Adobe Photoshop versions through CS2&#44; and many popular games such as World of Warcraft and Team Fortress 2. In other cases&#44; where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as desktop publishing[57] and professional audio&#44;,88272463_77 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,In February 2007&#44; an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that some of the professors at Harvard University include Wikipedia in their syllabi&#44; but that there is a split in their perception of using Wikipedia.[115] In June 2007&#44; former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia&#44; along with Google&#44;[116] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are &quot;the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything.&quot; He also said that &quot;a generation of intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the Internet&quot; was being produced at universities. He complains that the web-based sources are discouraging students from learning from the more rare texts which are either found only on paper or are on subscription-only web sites.,87350557_65 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,Because of less clearnce&#44; air pollution happens in places where people spend most of their time.  Radon (Rn) gas is a carcinogen&#44; which comes out of the earth at some places and spreads in the houses.  Formaldehyde (H2CO) gas is emitted from building materials like carpets and plywood.  While dryinig&#44; paints and solvents emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  Lead based paint can turn into dust and can go inside the body through breathing.  Deliberate air pollution is caused by air fresheners&#44; incense and other scented materials.  Smoke from the stoves in which wood is burnt in a controlled manner&#44; and from the fireplaces&#44; can add in considerable quantities to the inner and outer air&#44; the effect of smoking.  Insecticides&#39; and chemicals&#39; sprays without adequate ventillation can cause harmful effects by internal pollution.,87072463_4 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,Wikipedia has been accused of exhibiting systemic bias and inconsistency;[13] additionally&#44; critics argue that Wikipedia&#39;s open nature and a lack of proper sources for much of the information makes it unreliable.[107] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia is generally reliable&#44; but that the reliability of any given article is not always clear.[12] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopdia Britannica have questioned the project&#39;s utility and status as an encyclopedia.[108] Many university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work&#44; preferring primary sources;[109] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[110] Co-founder Jimmy Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate as primary sources&#44; and should not be relied upon as authoritative,86172463_2 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales founded Wikipedia.[23][24] While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia&#44;[25][26] Sanger is usually credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[27] On January 10&#44; 2001&#44; Larry Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a &quot;feeder&quot; project for Nupedia.[28] Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15&#44; 2001&#44; as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com&#44;[29] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[25] Wikipedia&#39;s policy of &quot;neutral point-of-view&quot;[30] was codified in its initial months&#44; and was similar to Nupedia&#39;s earlier &quot;nonbiased&quot; policy. Otherwise&#44; there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.,85472463_96 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,Wales performed a study finding that over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users (at the time: 524 people). This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz&#44; who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[128] A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that &quot;anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site.&quot;[129] Although some contributors are authorities in their field&#44; Wikipedia requires that even their contributions be supported by published and verifiable sources. The project&#39;s preference for consensus over credentials has been labeled &quot;anti-elitism.&quot;,8531149_228 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,User Account Control&#44; or UAC is perhaps the most significant and visible of these changes. UAC is a security technology that makes it possible for users to use their computer with fewer privileges by default&#44; with a view to stopping malware from making unauthorized changes to the system. This was often difficult in previous versions of Windows&#44; as the previous &quot;limited&quot; user accounts proved too restrictive and incompatible with a large proportion of application software&#44; and even prevented some basic operations such as looking at the calendar from the notification tray. In Windows Vista&#44; when an action is performed that requires administrative rights (such as installing/uninstalling software or making system-wide configuration changes)&#44; the user is first prompted for an administrator name and password,84672463_34 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Wikipedia&#39;s departure from the expert-driven style of the encyclopedia building mode and the large presence of unacademic content have been noted several times. When Time magazine recognized You as its Person of the Year for 2006&#44; acknowledging the accelerating success of online collaboration and interaction by millions of users around the world&#44; it cited Wikipedia as one of several examples of Web 2.0 services&#44; along with YouTube&#44; MySpace&#44; and Facebook.[18] Some noted the importance of Wikipedia not only as an encyclopedic reference but also as a frequently updated news resource because of how quickly articles about recent events appear.[19][20] Students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles&#44; as an exercise in clearly and succinctly explaining difficult concepts to an uninitiated audience.,83854_198 ,A2HYN509OGM53T ,Some popular films are: Mahal (1949)&#44; Sri 420 (1955)&#44; Mother India (1957)&#44; Mugal-a-Azam (1960)&#44; Guide (1965)&#44; Pakiza (1972)&#44; Bobi(1973)&#44; Zanzeer(1973)&#44;Yadoon ki Baraat (1973)&#44; Diwar (1975)&#44; Shole(1975)&#44; Mr.India (1987)&#44; Kayamat se Kayamat Tak (1988)&#44; Maine Pyar Kiya (1989)&#44; Jo Jeeta Wahi Sikander (1991)&#44; Ham Apke Hain Koun (1994)&#44; Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge (1995)&#44; Dil to Pagal Hai (1997)&#44; Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998)&#44; Taal (1999)&#44; Kaho na Pyaar Hai (2000)&#44; Lagaan(2001)&#44;Dil Chahaita Hai (2001)&#44; Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gum(2001)&#44; Devdas (2002)&#44; Saathiya (2002)&#44; Munna Bhai MBBS (2003)&#44; Kal Ho Na Ho (2003)&#44; Dhoom (2004)&#44; Veer-Zaara (2004)&#44;Swadesh (2004)&#44; Salaam Namaste (2005)&#44; Rang De Basanti (2006) etc.,8321149_285 ,A3J1PP96QX14U0 ,Windows Vista was released on November 30&#44; 2006 to business customers&#44; consumer versions following on January 30&#44; 2007. Windows Vista intended to have enhanced security by introducing a new restricted user mode called User Account Control&#44; replacing the &quot;administrator-by-default&quot; philosophy of Windows XP. One major difference between Vista and earlier versions of Windows&#44; Windows 95 and later&#44; is that the original start button was replaced with just the Windows icon. Vista also features new graphics features&#44; the Windows Aero GUI&#44; new applications (such as Windows Calendar&#44; Windows DVD Maker and some new games including Chess&#44; Mahjong&#44; and Purble Place)&#44;  Internet Explorer 7&#44; Windows Media Player 11&#44; and a large number of underlying architectural changes.,83172463_81 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,For legal reasons&#44; content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular copyright law) of Florida&#44; where Wikipedia servers are hosted.

The first&#44; &quot;In Memoriam: September 11 Wiki&#44;&quot;[204] created in October 2002&#44;[205] detailed the September 11 attacks; this project was closed in October 2006. Wiktionary&#44; a dictionary project&#44; was launched in December 2002;[206] Wikiquote&#44; a collection of quotations&#44; a week after Wikimedia launched&#44; and Wikibooks&#44; a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts. Wikimedia has since started a number of other projects&#44; including Wikiversity&#44; a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.[207] None of these sister projects&#44; however&#44; has come to meet the success of Wikipedia.,824872_293 ,AOG9H27586IOW ,Gandhi- enemy of state: The state of vision he envisaged was India not be a subordinate under any Government&#44; he opined that a nation should have true self rule meaning every person rules himself&#44; so that let it not be a nation in which it imposes any law on the people&#44; on many occasions he described himself to be a philosophical anarchist. He meant that an independent Indias integrity depended on thousands of small self dependent provinces ruled on its own&#44; which does not mean the established administrative system be given over to Indian nationals for which he remarked converting Hindustan to Englishstan. The British type of Parliamentary system on which he did not believe in&#44; he wished after Indian independence wanted to dismantle the Congress party and establish direct democratic system.,821884_182 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,Families and children play backyard cricket in suburban areas.  In India and Pakistan&#44; in the streets&#44; &quot;street cricket&quot;&#44; or &quot;tape ball&quot; is played (in long creeky streets it is played).  In this&#44; there are such rules like in one bounce&#44; it is considered a catch&#44; because of such rules and less space&#44; batsmen have to play cautiously.  Tennis balls and home made bats are used&#44; and many types of things are used as wickets&#44; for example&#44; in French Cricket&#44; biter leg.  This basically did not originate in France&#44; and mostly played by small children.  Sometimes the rules are improved: like&#44; fields man can catch the ball after one bounce in one hand.  Or if very few players only are available&#44; any body can field and the players bat by turns.,81645247_100 ,A1GEUMI28IQ2PS ,In 1271&#44; the Mongol leader and fifth Khagan of the Mongol Empire Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty&#44; with the last remnant of the Song Dynasty falling to the Yuan in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion&#44; Chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest was completed in 1279&#44; the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people.[26] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Mongols in 1368 and founded the Ming Dynasty.[27] Ming Dynasty thinkers such as Wang Yangming would further critique and expand Neo-Confucianism with ideas of individualism and innate morality that would have tremendous impact on later Japanese thought. Chosun Korea also became a nominal vassal state of Ming China and adopted much of its Neo-Confucian bureaucratic structure.,8138066_40 ,ATA8X60VC3SSB ,After this advice&#44; even today there are many clips of television show&#44; films&#44; music video which are on youtube.

Post 1960&#44; this trend has been observed that stratosphere has only become cold.Reduction of stratospheric ozone leads to coolness&#44; but ozone depletion did not happen till the decade of 1970. Due to solar variation and volcanic activities from industrial age till 1950&#44; it did not become hot but has become cooler only. In 2006&#44; Peter Foukal and other astrophysicists from USA&#44; Germany and Switzerland found that in the last 1000 years there has been no net increase in sun&#39;s brightness. Due to solar cycle&#44; in the last 30 years there is increase of only 0.07 %.

At present earth orbits the sun once for every roughly 366.26 times it rotates on its axis&#44; which is equal to 365.26 solar days&#44; or one sidereal year. The Earth axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 away form the perpendicular to its orbital plane&#44; producing seasonal varition ont the planet&#39;s surface whith a period of one tropical year(365.24 solar days). Earth&#39;s only known natural satellite&#44; the moon&#44; which began orbiting it about 4.53 billion years ago&#44; provides ocean tides&#44; stabilizes the axial tilt and gradually slows the plane&#39;s rotation.

Its also called as janmpatri in hindi&#44; kundli is classified as 12 sections. As circle has 360 degree so kundli&#39;s total area 360 degree is divided into 12 parts so each part have 30 degree&#44; these small parts of 30 degree is called as rashi (horroscope). these 12 rashis are called by different name in different languages.

What is hell? To whom does it apply? How to escape going to hell? What is Vaitarini and how does it look? these kind of details are explained here. Only sinners will have to go through the southern entrance of Yamapuri (the abode of Yama&#44; god of death) The Vaitarani lies towards the south. The ill luck of going through the southern side strikes only those who were born as human beings and have done things which they were not supposed to do&#44; so say the puranas.

It also introduced the first version of system restore&#44; which allowed users to revert their system state to a previous &quot;known-good&quot; point in the case of system failure. The first version of Windows Movie Maker was introduced as well.    Windows Me was conceived as a quick one-year project that served as a stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows XP. Many of the new features were available from the Windows Update site as updates for older Windows versions. As a result&#44; Windows Me was not acknowledged as a unique Operating System along the lines of 95 or 98&#44; and is often included in the Windows 9x series.,7931529_60 ,A16IVTYAYSV3SA ,Among these there are: &#39;Chashar Song&#39; (The Masque of a Farmer)&#44; &#39;Shakuni Badh&#39; (The Killing of Shakuni (a villain of the India epic Mahabharata))&#44; &#39;Raja Judhisthirer Song&#39; (The Masque of the King Judhisthir (a king in the Indian epic Mahabharata))&#44; &#39;Data Karna&#39; (The Benevolent King Karna (a king of the Indian epic Mahabharata))&#44; &#39;Akbar Badsah&#39; (The Emperor Akbar)&#44; &#39;Kabi Kalidas&#39; (Poet Kalidas)&#44; &#39;vidyabhutum&#39; (Scary Education)&#44; &#39;Rajputrer Gaan&#39; (The Songs of the Prince)&#44; &#39;Buro Shaliker Ghade Ron&#39; (The Fur in the Shoulder of an Old Shalik Bird (a small yellow-beaked singing bird)) and &#39;Meghnad Badh&#39; (The Assassination of Meghnad (a prince of the Indian epic Ramayana)).,7871149_292 ,A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 ,In 2003&#44; the SCO Group started legal action against various users and vendors of Linux. SCO had alleged that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code now owned by The SCO Group. Other allegations included trade-secret violations by IBM&#44; or contract violations by former Santa Cruz customers who had since converted to Linux. However&#44; Novell disputed the SCO Group&#39;s claim to hold copyright on the UNIX source base. According to Novell&#44; SCO (and hence the SCO Group) are effectively franchise operators for Novell&#44; which also retained the core copyrights&#44; veto rights over future licensing activities of SCO&#44; and 95% of the licensing revenue. The SCO Group disagreed with this&#44; and the dispute resulted in the SCO v. Novell lawsuit.

Vamana is a disguise of a short Brahman&#44; carrying a wooden umbrella requested three steps of land for him to live in. Given a promise of three steps of land by King Mahabali against the warning given by his Guru Sukracharya&#44; Vamana&#44; The Supreme God grows so huge that he could cover from heaven to earth&#44; earth to lower worlds in two simple steps. King Mahabali unable to fulfil the promise of three paces of land to the Supreme God&#44; offers his head for the third step. Thus Vamana places his foot on King Mahabali&#39;s head and gives him immortality for his benevolence.,78619296_143 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,Annexure 74 considers it compulsory for the Prime Minister to preside over and manage the cabinet.In case of his resignation or death&#44; the cabinet is considered to be dissolved. The rime Minister holds the ultimate power to appoint the cabinet&#44; The President appoints the cabinet according to the say of teh Prime Minister. He solely decides the portfolios of the ministers. He gives orders to all government institutions and the final decisions also rest with him.He is the central figure between the President and the cabinet of ministers. He is the speaker and leads debates and discussions. He can debate any topic raised in the parliament. He can check the work of any ministry. These are the reasons why he is considered the most important political figure in the country.,78684960_176 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The devotees believe that the Nandi idol in front of the temple is continuously increasing its size. The locals say that the idol was initially much smaller than its present size. They say that certain experimentation was carried out on this idol and it was said that the type of rock out of which the idol is carved has a growing or enlarging nature associated with it. As per Archaeological Survey of India the rock grows at the rate of 1 inch per 20 years (10 mm per 8 years).  It is said that people used to do Pradakshinas (rounds) around it in the past. The temple staff has already removed one pillar as the size of the Nandi has increased.  According to Potuluri Veera Brahmendra swamy&#44; the Basavanna (stone nandi) of Yaganti will come alive and shout when Kali Yuga ends.,78455057_207 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,The Lost Decade (10 Ushinawareta Jnen?) is the time after the Japanese asset price bubble&#39;s collapse within the Japanese economy&#44; which occurred gradually rather than catastrophically. It consists of the years 1991 to 2000.The strong economic growth of the 1980s ended abruptly at the start of the 1990s. In the late 1980s&#44; abnormalities within the Japanese economic system had fueled a massive wave of speculation by Japanese companies&#44; banks and securities companies. A combination of exceptionally high land values and exceptionally low interest rates briefly led to a position in which credit was both easily available and extremely cheap. This led to massive borrowing&#44; the proceeds of which were invested mostly in domestic and foreign stocks and securities.,7841149_227 ,A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 ,Microsoft developed Windows 3.1&#44; which included several minor improvements to Windows 3.0&#44; but primarily consisted of bugfixes and multimedia support. It also excluded support for Real mode&#44; and only ran on an 80286 or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11&#44; a touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992.    Meanwhile Microsoft continued to develop Windows NT. The main architect of the system was Dave Cutler&#44; one of the chief architects of VMS at Digital Equipment Corporation (later purchased by Compaq&#44; now part of Hewlett-Packard).[4] Microsoft hired him in August 1988 to create a successor to OS/2&#44; but Cutler created a completely new system instead.,78328539_101 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,Serious bad assaults by local pollution helped improve awareness.  PCB: In 1974&#44; EPA inposed a ban on use of fish from Hudson river&#44; as a result of filth and garbage being thrown in it.  IN 1947&#44; dioxin pollution of Love Canal started&#44; and continued for a long time&#44; became a national news in 1978&#44; and as its consequence the Super Fund Law of 1980 was made.  In 1990&#44; legal machinery brought to light production of Chromium -6 in California&#44; whose victims were champions and they became famous.  By reason of pollution of industrial land&#44; one word originated - Brownfield.  This word has now become an integral part of city planning.After the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson&#44; DDT was banned in most of the developed world.,7773315_24 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Unlike its predecessor&#44; Windows Vista&#44; which introduced a large number of new features&#44; Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused&#44; incremental upgrade to the Windows line&#44; with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware which Windows Vista was not at the time.[7] Presentations given by Microsoft in 2008 focused on multi-touch support&#44; a redesigned Windows shell with a new taskbar&#44; referred to as the Superbar&#44; a home networking system called HomeGroup&#44;[8] and performance improvements. Some standard applications that have been included with prior releases of Microsoft Windows&#44; including Windows Calendar&#44; Windows Mail&#44; Windows Movie Maker&#44; and Windows Photo Gallery&#44; are not included in Windows 7,776872_262 ,A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST ,In United Kingdom&#44; idols of Gandhiji are installed at famous places like at the Tavistock Square near the University College London as he studied law there. United Kingdom observes January 30 as National Gandhi Memorial Day. In the United States&#44; the idols of Mahatma Gandhi are installed outside the Union Square&#44; New York&#44; at the Martin Luther King&#44; Jr. National Historic Site&#44; Atlanta and on Massachusetts street near the India Embassy&#44; Washington D.C.   Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s idol is also installed at Pietermaitzburg&#44; South Africa where he was asked to leave the first class compartment of a train in 1893. Gandhiji&#39;s idols are also present at Madam Tussaud&#39;s wax museams in London&#44; New York and other cities of the world.,7701762_242 ,A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 ,Conceptions of God vary widely. Theologians and philosophers have studied countless conceptions of God since the dawn of civilization. The Abrahamic conceptions of God include the monotheistic definition of God in Judaism&#44; the trinitarian view of Christians&#44; and the Islamic concept of God. The dharmic religions differ in their view of the divine: views of God in Hinduism vary by region&#44; sect&#44; and caste&#44; ranging from monotheistic to polytheistic to atheistic; the view of God in Buddhism is almost non-theist. In modern times&#44; some more abstract concepts have been developed&#44; such as process theology and open theism. Conceptions of God held by individual believers vary so widely that there is no clear consensus on the nature of God.[15],7701149_273 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Until about 2000&#44; users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the de facto standard&#44; but at that time&#44; other desktop environments such as GNOME and KDE SC were quickly becoming mature&#44; and became almost universal on the Linux platform&#44; which already had a larger user base than most commercial Unixes in total.SunSoft&#44; HP&#44; IBM and USL announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative. The primary environment was based on HP&#39;s VUE (Visual User Environment)&#44; itself derived from the Motif Window Manager (mwm). IBM contributed its Common User Access model and Workplace Shell. Novell provided desktop manager components and scalable systems technologies from UNIX System V.,76645247_94 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,In Taiwan&#44; the relationship between Mandarin and other languages in Taiwan&#44; particularly Taiwanese Hokkien&#44; has been more heated politically. During the martial law period under the Kuomintang (KMT) between 1949 and 1987&#44; the KMT government discouraged or&#44; in some cases&#44; forbade the use of Taiwanese Minnan and other vernaculars. This produced a political backlash in the 1990s. Under the administration of Chen Shui-Bian&#44; other Taiwanese languages were taught as an individual class&#44; with dedicated textbooks and course materials. The former President&#44; Chen Shui-Bian&#44; often spoke in Taiwanese Minnan during speeches&#44; while after late 1990s&#44; former President Lee Teng-hui&#44; also speaks Taiwanese Minnan openly.,76345708_46 ,A1O9BHBJKVI5PS ,This is a result of a good alteration in the chair-with-handles position. This method provides an opportunity for spectacular friction after entry&#44; which increases the quality of pleasure. To attain this position the man should sit with his legs spread with the support of his arms. then the woman should bring her vagina to the man&#39;s penis while spreading her legs in the same manner while bending backwards with the support of her arms. During this her legs are a little bent at the knees&#44; which help her move up and down. Though in this position the woman&#39;s arms upon bearing the force feel a little tired affecting the speed of coitus&#44; but this sex position becomes explosive and ecstatic when the woman is stiff with strong muscle power.,76210164_33 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,Dunzig was a city that was ruled by the League of Nations after its separation from Germany in the post First World War period&#44; and was part of Poland&#44; which was established after the War.When Hitler made plans to conquer Dunzig&#44; France and England offered their support to Poland for its indepandence.When Italy attacked Albania&#44; they gave their support to Greece and Romania as well.The Soviet Union also tried to join hands with France and England&#44; but western countries opposed this because they distrusted the intentions and capabilities of the Soviet Union.After the support of France and England to Poland&#44; Italy and Germany signed the Agreement Pact of Steel&#44; which stated that they are totally in accordance with each other.,76150557_164 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,Roadway air dispersion model was evolved in the end of 1950s and the beginning of 1960 for helping National Environmental Policy Act and U.S.Department of Transportation (then known as Highways Social Law).  Air Quality on the highways&#44; specially regulating groups in the cities&#44; helped development of many models.  Some such groups are:  Environmental Research and Technology (ERT)group of Lexington&#44; Massachusetts); ESL Inc. group of Sunnyvale&#44; California; California Air Resources Board group of Sacramento&#44; California.  ESL group collaborates with the United States Environmental Protection Agency in characterising sulfur hexafluoride as a contributing gas.  This program was successful in developing the line source model of ESL Inc.,759872_263 ,A39FCCRBQ8Q4ST ,Gandhiji never received a Nobel Prize for peace though he was nominated for it 5 times during 1936 and 1947 which also included a nomination from the American Friends Service Committee. The Nobel Committee declared after decades that it regretted their mistake and also accepted that the reason for not awarding him this prize was his Split national ideology. Mahatma Gandhi was to receive this prize in 1948 but it could not proceed due to his assassination. Another reason was the formation Indian and Pakistan the two new countries which were at war. During 1948 the prize was given as there was no candidate alive. And when Dalai Lama was awarded this prize the president of the committee stated that this was a part of tribute offered to Mahatma Gandhi.,75835753_242 ,A30DCB3TFOQO3B ,Ethiopia has same number of Muslims as that of Afghanistan. so there is no meaning in assuming that Arabs are The Muslims.60 percent of the Muslims are in Asia.Another 20 percent in the Middle East and North Africa regions&#44;15 percent in Sub Saharan region of Africa&#44;2.4 percent in Europe&#44;0.3 percent in America.Asia has more Muslim predominant populated countries than the others. 1/5th of the Muslims (31.7 crores) are in 5 countries where Islam is not the main religion. 3/4th of the Muslims are in 5 countries (India 16.1 cr&#44;Ethiopia 2.8 cr&#44;China 2.2 cr&#44;Russia 1.6 cr&#44;Tanzania 1.3 cr)&#44; where Muslims are considered minority.Indonesia has highest Muslim population of 20.3 crores and India with 16.1 crores is in 3rd place.,75734672_139 ,A3J1PP96QX14U0 ,Unlike the rest of the planets in the Solar System&#44; mankind did not perceive the Earth as a planet until the 16th century. Earth has often been personified as a deity&#44; in particular a goddess. In many cultures the mother goddess is also portrayed as a fertility deity. Creation myths in many religions recall a story involving the creation of the Earth by a supernatural deity or deities. A variety of religious groups&#44; often associated with fundamentalist branches of Protestantism  or Islam&#44;  assert that their interpretations of these creation myths in sacred texts are literal truth and should be considered alongside or replace conventional scientific accounts of the formation of the Earth and the origin and development of life.,75172463_179 ,A3J1PP96QX14U0 ,In July 2007&#44; Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Radio 4 which argued that&#44; with increased usage and awareness&#44; the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the term is one of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar (Google&#44; Facebook&#44; YouTube) that they no longer need explanation and are on a par with such 20th-century terms as Hoovering or Coca-Cola. Many parody Wikipedia&#39;s openness&#44; with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project&#39;s articles. Notably&#44; comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term &quot;wikiality&quot;,7461149_291 ,A1RAFJLFW2X2V6 ,Since the newer commercial UNIX licensing terms were not as favorable for academic use as the older versions of Unix&#44; the Berkeley researchers continued to develop BSD Unix as an alternative to UNIX System III and V&#44; originally on the PDP-11 architecture (the 2.xBSD releases&#44; ending with 2.11BSD) and later for the VAX-11 (the 4.x BSD releases). Many contributions to Unix first appeared on BSD releases&#44; notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel. The BSD effort produced several significant releases that contained network code: 4.1cBSD&#44; 4.2BSD&#44; 4.3BSD&#44; 4.3BSD-Tahoe,74426300_141 ,A2FDXVWVI05XA4 ,Report drafted by the second executive group of IPCC Third Assessment Report&#44; presents A comprehensive explanation of the potential effects and a summary can be found in the draft submitted by the second executive group of IPCC Third Assessment Report.

Sufism is known as &quot;Islamic Mysticism&#44;&quot; in which Muslims seek to find divine love and knowledge through direct personal experience of God.,7371011_12 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,After about 535 mya&#44; five mass extinctions happened.  The last event of these extinctions in 65 mya by a meteorite collision.  This triggered the extinction of dynosaures and other big reptiles (other than birds)&#44; but developed the small mammals which were then similar to squirrels.  From the past 65 lakh years&#44; life of the mammals got diversified and many lakh years ago an animal similar to the African monkey developed the ability to stand erect.  This used tools and stimulated transport equipment.  This provided the stimulus and nourishment necessary for a super brain.  Development of agriculture&#44; and then civilisation enabled man to influence the earth and thereby influence the nature and other living beings.,7379201_7 ,A1CWCJ8MKSQHPI ,A round table conference on peace in 2004 proposed that a distinction be made between terrorism and terror acts&#44; according to the Strategic Foresight Group.The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1371 and the Domestic Prudence will remain in operation as long as terror acts in the world continue. There are terror acts in almost all parts of the world. Terror groups aim the acts at hightlighting a single issue. There have been difference in opinion regarding the definition of Terrorism here.But it is a common consensus that terror acts must not be accepted in any case.This is stressed in meetings of the United Nations.Counter terrorism is a method of war. Madrid Convention&#44;and Alde  and the European Parliament.,7341149_17 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories&#44; originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections&#44; but they had a fixed number of levels&#44; often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC&#39;s RSX-11M&#39;s &quot;group&#44; user&quot; hierarchy evolved into VMS directories&#44; CP/M&#39;s volumes evolved into MS-DOS 2.0+ subdirectories&#44; and HP&#39;s MPE group.account hierarchy and IBM&#39;s SSP and OS/400 library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.,7322730_374 ,A2OE1LT946KVM9 ,Many institutions of higher learning and research are situated in Kolkata : Asiatic Soceity&#44; Basu Vigyan mandir&#44; Indian Statistical Institute&#44; Indian Institute of Management&#44; Indian Association for Cultivation of Sciences&#44; variable Energy Cyclotron Centre&#44; Saha Insitue of Nuclear Physics&#44; Center for Studies in Social Sciences&#44; marine Engineering and research Institute&#44; Indian Institute of Science Education and Research&#44; Satyendranath Basu national Center for basic Sciences&#44; Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management&#44; National institute of fashion Technology&#44; Institute of Costs and Works Accountants of India and Indian Institute of Chemical Biology&#44;,7281149_289 ,A15YKQU4TT7169 ,In the 1960s&#44; Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#44; AT&amp;T Bell Labs&#44; and General Electric developed an experimental operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.[2] Multics was highly innovative&#44; but had many problems.  Bell Labs&#44; frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims&#44; slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics&#44; Ken Thompson&#44; Dennis Ritchie&#44; M. D. McIlroy&#44; and J. F. Ossanna&#44;[3] decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. At the time&#44; Ritchie says &quot;What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming&#44; but a system around which a fellowship could form.,7272646_12 ,A2OCN0KL27QMTP ,Private Mobiles phone system and modem used in Japan around 1997-2003&#44;Motorola TAC&#44; was the first mobile phone to be approved by the FCC in United States.n 1984&#44; Bell Labs developed modern commercial cellular technology (most of Gladden&#44; Parelman patent based)&#44; which contain multiple center base stations (cell sites) to be employed&#44; each used to service a small area (a cell). Cell sites were installed in such a way that the cells used to partially overlap. A cellular system&#44; a base station (cell site) and a terminal (phone) between the signal should only be so strong that it could reach between the two points&#44; in order to separate the different calls and use the same channel together.,7251149_174 ,A3J1PP96QX14U0 ,While many simpler operating systems support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems&#44; operating systems like UNIX and GNU/Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS. An operating system like UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices&#44; regardless of their design or file systems to be accessed through a common application programming interface (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers.,72528539_103 ,AL9K2BNO4E0F4 ,During the cold war&#44; research into the nuclear weapons was being done&#44; specially in the early stages of their development&#44; sometimes near the settlement regions also.  The effect of this on population and its development is very bad&#44; radioactivity is a serious danger to human health&#44; the difficulties in banning it are related to nuclear power.  Though lot of caution is exercised in this field&#44; still the magnitude of the damage caused by the incidents of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl caused a disbelief in people&#44; considering future difficulties.  Most forms of nuclear research were banned.
