That was picture of an Israel&#39;s departmental store&#44; this store was very popular in 1930 in all across of Germany. This store was a very large trading center.

21031_42 	AZMCPOS91CH8N 	Einstein noted that the photoelectric effect depended on the wavelength&#44; and hence the frequency of the light.
21031_43 	A3AH3NPF2NG7F4 	The theory of light was first presented by Max Planck.
21031_44 	A3AH3NPF2NG7F4 	Second dissertation was the mathematical model of Brownian motion in which with the use of light the motion of particles in liquid was interpreted.

2115_202 	A2KMRPCKI6YGYK 	Afghanistan is in the list of poor countries in the world
2115_203 	A1WYSSW33M2FZ2 	The primary reason behind this is the problems among America and Russia and their common interests in this area.
2115_204 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	Afghanistan has been constantly engulfed in war and never had the time for economic development.
2115_205 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	A huge part of Afghanistan&#39;s population migrated towards Pakistan and Iran. Some of them have started coming back&#44; but the migration has devastated their economy and the new generation has received few chances of education and skill development.
2115_206 	A1WYSSW33M2FZ2 	People in Afghanistan who did not migrate&#44; were kept busy in the war.
2115_207 	A25L9IW94S2H6G 	Hence they were forced to trade arms&#44; Cocaine &amp; Heroine &amp; indulge in war as a source of income.
2115_208 	A1WYSSW33M2FZ2 	A large number was also associated with smuggling.
2115_209 	A25L9IW94S2H6G 	Other crops are also harvested other than cocaine but in a very small number.
2115_210 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	According to the Asian Development Bank&#44; economy has developed significantly since 2001&#44; but no credible sources are found in this regard.
2115_211 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	Nonetheless&#44; the Afghans living outside Afghanistan have begun some investment. For example&#44; an Afghan family in Dubai opened a Coca Cola plant in 2005 in Afghanistan with $250 million.
2115_141 	A3AH3NPF2NG7F4 	But when they were not longer needed to America then same Mujhahideen were used to be called as terrorist by America and Pakistan.
2115_142 	A3AH3NPF2NG7F4 	American CIA&#44; Pakistan&#44; America and Saudi Arabia played their role during that time in which these countries had some common and personal interests.
2115_143 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	The result of this Jihad was that that Russia had to completely withdraw from Afghanistan in 1989. In fact&#44; as in the opinion of some scholars&#44; it was a big factor in the breakup of Russia.
2115_144 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	For this reason Russia&#44; Afghanistan and Pakistan signed an agreement in Geneva in 1988
2115_145 	AZMCPOS91CH8N 	After the Russians
2115_146 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	Even after pulling troops out of Afghanistan&#44; Russia kept on supporting the regime of Najibullah Khan. But on 18th April&#44; 1992&#44; a group of Mujaheddin led by General Abdul Rasheed Dostam and Ahmad Shah Masud captured Kabul&#44; and declared Afghanistan an Islamic Republic.
2115_147 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	But the power struggle&#44; aided by US weaponry&#44; ensued between different Mujaheddin groups.
2115_148 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	At this point an Islamic Jihadi Council was created which was initially led by Sabgat ullah Majdari and later on by Burhanuddin Rabbani. But the fighting between the mujahideen continued to increase
2115_149 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	Foreign powers fully exploited the mutual enmity between the Pashto and Farsi speakers.
2115_150 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	The representation of Pashtuns in that period&#39;s regime was close to none&#44; which caused a sense of deprivation among them.
2115_151 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	Some Ullemas from Pakistan and Afghanistan began to organize the students (Tallaba) of Madrassas (schools with an emphasis on religious education)&#44; who later became known as Taliban.
10824_242 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	Moreover&#44; it was the only army which utilized the services of foreign experts. Their officers were sent to the western European countries for training.
10824_243 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	Janissaries
10824_244 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	Empire&#39;s power depended upon its military system.
10824_245 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	The army was given a organized shape during the era of the second Ottoman emperor and Khan I&#44; which became known as Janissary.
10824_246 	AZMCPOS91CH8N 	The Janissary force became particularly significant when the foot soldier carrying firearms proved more effective than the cavalry equipped with sword and spear and for three centuries they kept the fear among the European forces. It was the main cause for the earlier victories gained by the Ottoman Empire.

2178_31 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	The British High Comissioner Henry McMohan in 1916&#44; promised to the Egyptians that besides the Arab areas which were part of the Usmani empire&#44; all areas will be freed&#44; but Britian slyly did a secret agreement by the name of &quot;Sykes Pact&quot;&#44; under which Britain and France distributed the Arab areas by common consent
2178_32 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	Therefore while breaking their promise&#44; the British captured Palestine in 1918&#44; at the end of the first World War
2178_33 	A22KNHLEDEI42N 	League of Nations declared the capture of Palestine by the British as lawful
2178_34 	A22KNHLEDEI42N 	Britain did more cleverness like this that in 1917 the British Foreign Minister Arthur Belfore wrote a letter from Britain&#39;s side to the Zionist leader Lord Rathshield in which he assured to form the Jewish state in Israel
2178_35 	A22KNHLEDEI42N 	In Palestine the goal of establishing Jewish state was to form a Zionist center which would not have been possible without evacuating Palestinians and capturing their lands
2178_36 	A22KNHLEDEI42N 	Therefore as soon as the Jews started coming from Europe Palestinians were forced to leave from there
2178_37 	A1WYSSW33M2FZ2 	Britain&#44; after recovering from the second world war&#44; handed over the matter of Palestine to the United Nations in 1947.
2178_38 	A1WYSSW33M2FZ2 	Until that time&#44; the population of the Jews in Palestine had become one third but they were the owner of only 6% land of Palestine.
2178_39 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	The United Nations made a committee&#44; which proposed that on 56.5% of the Palestinian land&#44; a country by the name of Israel should be made for 6% of the Jewish people&#44; and after taking out the Bait ul Muqaddas as international territory&#44; the remaining 40% of the land should be given to the 94% of the people
2178_40 	A1WYSSW33M2FZ2 	on 29th November 1947&#44; the general assembly approved this with 33 votes against 13.

847_248 	A19B5AHVCXP765 	The constitution of United States is the greatest legal document in American system&#44; and it can be considered as social agreement&#44; which is between the American citizens and their government.
847_249 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	Federal and state governments have all their laws scrutinized which are against the constitution&#44; and the judiciary can end them

847_254 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	However it is debatable as to how much these laws are being used
847_255 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	The constitution specifies a democratic form of government but there is very little information on it
847_256 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	The influences of Republican Party and Democratic Party upon US politics are very deep&#44; and power resides to these parties only.
847_257 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	These parties are also in majority in federal&#44; state and grassroots governments.
847_258 	A1ZSKDWK3U7KKR 	Independent candidates perform better in grassroots governments&#44; although some of them are also present in the Senate and House of Representatives.

4005_196 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	IN March 628&#44; an agreement between the people of Medina and the non believers took place which is known as the Tresty of Hudaibia (known in arabic as Sulah Hudaibia)
4005_197 	A29T1GZFGRLWDM 	In the year 628 (6 Hijri)&#44; the Prophet Muhammad went from Medina to Mecca along with 1400 Muslims

4005_204 	A1B6VQGOT2G4TL 	For instance&#44;should a Muslim join the unbelievers of Mecca he would not be returned; but if any unbeliever after conversion to Islam went to Medina  without  permission of from his elders&#44;he would have to be returned.
4005_205 	A1WYSSW33M2FZ2 	But because of the intellect of Hazrat Muhammad&#44; the pact of reconciliation was done.
4005_206 	A1WYSSW33M2FZ2 	Its main condition was that no war will be fought for 10 years and Muslims will return this year and will come for Umrah next year.
